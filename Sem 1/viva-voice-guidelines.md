### 1. **General Tips for Communication**
   - **Stay Calm and Confident:** Take a deep breath if you feel nervous. Speak slowly and clearly, and try not to rush through your answers. Confidence comes from understanding, so ensure you're well-prepared.
   - **Listen Carefully:** Before answering, listen to the question completely. Make sure you understand it before you start speaking. It’s better to ask for clarification than to give an incorrect answer.
   - **Take Your Time to Answer:** Think for a few seconds before answering. It’s okay to pause briefly to gather your thoughts. This shows that you’re thoughtful, not just speaking off the top of your head.
   
### 2. **When to Talk & How to Organize Your Answer**
   - **Break Down Complex Answers:** If a question requires a detailed response, break it into smaller parts. Start by addressing the main point and then dive deeper into the details, if necessary.
   - **Use Examples:** Use examples or case studies where possible. For example, if asked about a concept in **Visual Programming**, mention how a particular tool or framework works in practice.
   - **Clarify if Necessary:** If you're unsure about what’s being asked, it’s perfectly fine to ask the examiner to repeat or rephrase the question.
     - **Example sentence:** “I’m sorry, could you please repeat the question?” or “I just want to confirm, are you asking about…?”

### 3. **How to Request for Repeating or Clarifying Questions**
   - If you didn’t hear the question clearly or you’re unsure about it, don’t hesitate to ask the examiner to clarify.
     - “Could you please clarify that question?”
     - “I’m sorry, I didn’t quite catch that. Could you repeat it, please?”
     - “I’m not sure I understand completely, can you elaborate a little more on the point you’re referring to?”
   
   - **If you misunderstand a question**, instead of diving into an answer, acknowledge it and ask for more time.
     - “Sorry, could you rephrase the question? I want to make sure I understand it correctly.”


### 4. **Using English Idioms & Phrases**
   Incorporating idioms or professional expressions can make your answers sound more fluent and polished. Here are a few idioms and phrases you can use:

   - **Clarification:**
     - “Just to clear things up…”

     - “To sum up…”
     - “So, to answer your question, the main points are…”

### 6. **Body Language**
   - Maintain eye contact with the examiner.
   - Sit upright but relaxed.
   - Don’t fidget, as it can be distracting.
