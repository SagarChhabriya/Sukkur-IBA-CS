 I am a backbencher and I love the fact that I am, it has manifold advantages which we will explore together throughout my presentation.

Front benchers Know what is happening on the board But backbenchers know what is happening in the class.
front benchers are the face of class whereas the backbenchers are the soul of class.
front benchers are pressurised to maintain the discipline because whosoever enters in the class they will look first at the front benchers.
however the backbenchers are relaxed ,they sit the way they want to ,they eat and some of them even use mobile phones...I don't encourage this but that's true....

front benchers know the solution of problem
backbenchers know how to face the problem
said by one of my favourite movie character.....don't ask me which character...let me tell some facts

even the front benchers  secretly like backbenchers....ask me why??? bhai poochoo to sahi......
A common human brain listen any thing not more than forty minutes after the forty minutes the brain needs break, but the front benchers will not ask the teacher for break ,these are the backbencher who are the saviour of our class.ðŸ¤£ I  mean the saviour of brain....after the class say thanks to the backbenchers for saving your brain....if teacher does'nt give break the backbencher will stop listening themselves...that is why someone said that..

"Best brains of the Nations may be found on the last benches of classroom"

first benchers make friends for notes but backbenchers make friends for life. backbenchers take out time for friend along with studies. They enjoy life with them. Their friendships are stronger. they remain together through thick and thin.  

my great advice to front benchers is not to challenge the backbenchers because you are front bencher until the someone sit at back..
any query...meet me at the last bench of our class
