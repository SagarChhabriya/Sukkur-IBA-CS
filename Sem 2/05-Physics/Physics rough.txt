Resistor: To reduce the number of the flowing electrons, to control the flow of electrons,
to secure the circuit, or to bound the circuit
If we increase the voltage than the current will increase. (Directly Proportional)
If we increase the resistance than the currnt will decrease. (Inversely Proportional)
Georhe Simhon Ohm
Applied on semi-conductors, or ohmic conductors.
Can't applied on Gas, Liquid and ..........., 
because it is a Linear relationship.
-------------------
Series circuit: Single path, two or more resistors,combinational circuit.
same input and same output, because the wires of the battery are directly connected with the resistors.
