## Chapter 6: Legal Structures and Equity Distribution

### 6.2.2 The Extent of Limited Liability

- **Protection from Liability**: Limited liability protects the personal assets of business owners and managers from the business's financial or legal problems, as long as the business is properly formed and managed according to legal requirements.

- **Example of Liability**: If an employee orders goods on credit and the business cannot pay, the business itself is liable for the debt. In an unlimited liability entity, owners would be personally responsible. In a limited liability entity, owners are shielded from personal liability.

- **Personal Liability for Wrongdoing**: Owners and managers are still personally liable if they engage in misconduct. For example, if an employee knowingly orders goods knowing the business can't pay, they could be personally liable.

- **Corporate Veil**: Limited liability entities create a "corporate veil" protecting owners' personal assets. However, this veil is disregarded in certain cases, such as:
  - **Criminal Acts**: Courts can ignore limited liability protection for criminal actions by owners or directors.
  - **Tax Liability**: Owners and officers may be personally responsible for unpaid payroll taxes, even if they weren't directly involved in daily operations.

- **Piercing the Corporate Veil**: Courts may impose liability on owners if the business structure is abused. This can happen in cases such as:
  - **Defective Creation**: If the business wasn't properly established, it may be treated as a sole proprietorship or partnership, and owners will be personally liable.
  - **Failure to Follow Formalities**: If the business isn't treated as separate from its owners (e.g., the business is just an "alter ego"), the court may pierce the corporate veil.
  - **Fraud or Improper Intent**: If the business was set up to shield owners from fraudulent activities or debts, the veil may be pierced, and owners may be held liable.
  - **Statutory Requirements**: Certain laws (like federal securities laws) can impose personal liability on those controlling a limited liability entity.

- **Actions That Can Lead to Personal Liability**:
  - Using company funds or assets for personal use.
  - Mixing personal assets with company assets (commingling).
  - Hiring employees who donâ€™t perform any work but still get paid.
  - The company assuming personal debt of the owner.
  - Nonpayment or excessive payment of dividends in corporations.
  - Engaging in fraudulent activities to avoid creditor obligations.
  - Misrepresentations or fraud by owners or management.
  - Giving unreasonable loans or benefits to company officials.
  - Issuing corporate guarantees for loans/contracts benefiting an owner.
  - Failing to separate personal activities from corporate activities.

- **Statutory Personal Liability**: In some cases, the law imposes personal liability for corporate debts, such as:
  - Employer tax withholding obligations.
  - Wage and retirement benefits.
  - Environmental liability.
  - Violations of federal securities laws.
  - Contractual obligations (e.g., personal guarantees by shareholders).

- **Making an Informed Choice**: With these risks in mind, entrepreneurs can now make an informed decision about which legal structure to choose for their new venture.
