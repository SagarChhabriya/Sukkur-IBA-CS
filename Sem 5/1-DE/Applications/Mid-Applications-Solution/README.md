# Mathematical Modeling Problems

## Problem 1: Bacterial Growth

The rate of increase in the number of bacteria in a certain bacteria culture is proportional to the number present. Given that the number triples in 5 hours, find how many bacteria will be present after 10 hours.

## Problem 2: Population Growth

Find the population of a city at any time \( t \), given that the rate of increase of population is proportional to the population at that instant and that in a period of 40 years, the population increased from 300,000 to 400,000.

## Problem 5: Continuous Compound Interest

A person deposits Rs. 10,000 in a bank account at a rate of 5% per annum compounded continuously. How much money will be in his bank account 18 months later?


---

## Problem 6: Radioactive Decay

Assume that the rate at which radioactive nuclei decay is proportional to the number of such nuclei that are present. In a certain sample, 10% of the original number of radioactive nuclei have undergone disintegration in a period of 100 years. What percentage of the original radioactive nuclei will remain after 1000 years?

## Problem 7: Cooling of Water

Water at a temperature of 100º C cools in 10 minutes to 80º C in a room temperature of 25º C. Find:
1. The temperature of water after 20 minutes.
2. The time when the temperature is 40º C.

## Problem 8: Cooling Coffee

At 10:00 A.M., a woman took a cup of hot instant coffee from her microwave oven at 180º F. After 10 minutes, it was 160º F. The kitchen temperature was 70º F. 

1. What was the temperature of the coffee at 10:15 A.M.?
2. The woman likes to drink coffee when its temperature is between 130º F and 140º F. Between what times should she have drunk the coffee?

## Problem 9: Cooling of Boiling Water

A pot of boiling water at 100º C is removed from a stove at time \( t = 0 \). After 5 minutes, it has cooled to 80º C, and after another 5 minutes, it has dropped to 65º C. Determine the temperature of the kitchen.
