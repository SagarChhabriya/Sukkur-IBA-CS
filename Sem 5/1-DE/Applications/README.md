# Formation of D.E
Differential Equations from physical phenomenon: The problems that involve rate of change of one variable with respect to time always give rise to D.E.


## 1. Growth and Decay Problems


## 2. Applications of Linear D.E

### Investment
Ex:
1. Adding to an account
2. Adding to an account with income growth
3. Paying of a load
4. Blood
5. Population with emigration
6. Heat and Cooling
   
## 3. Newton's Law of Cooling
