### **Key Concept Overview:**
In **hypergeometric distribution**, you are drawing from a finite population without replacement. Unlike binomial distributions, which assume independent trials (with replacement), the hypergeometric distribution is used when there is a fixed population, and each selection affects the next one. It can be applied in scenarios where you're interested in the number of successes in a fixed sample drawn from a larger population containing both successes and failures.

The **hypergeometric probability formula** is given by:

$$
P(X = k) = \frac{\binom{K}{k} \binom{N-K}{n-k}}{\binom{N}{n}}
$$

Where:
- $N$ = total population size,
- $K$ = total number of successes in the population,
- $n$ = sample size,
- $k$ = number of successes in the sample.

### **Key Concept Overview:**
The **Poisson distribution** is used to model the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space, given a known average rate of occurrence. It assumes events happen independently of each other and occur at a constant average rate.

The **Poisson probability formula** is given by:

$$
P(X = k) = \frac{\lambda^k e^{-\lambda}}{k!}
$$

Where:
- $\lambda$ = average rate (mean number of events in the interval),
- $k$ = actual number of events (successes),
- $e$ = Euler's number (approximately 2.71828).

The formula calculates the probability of observing **exactly** $k$ events in a fixed interval when the average rate is $\lambda$.

---

### **Examples:**
1. **Question**: A rare disease occurs in a population with an average of 2 new cases per month. What is the probability that exactly 4 new cases will be diagnosed in a given month?

   **Solution**: 
   - $\lambda = 2$
   - $k = 4$
   
   Using the Poisson formula:
   
$$
P(X = 4) = \frac{2^4 e^{-2}}{4!} = \frac{16 \cdot e^{-2}}{24} \approx 0.180
$$

3. **Question**: A city experiences an average of 3 traffic accidents per week. What is the probability that exactly 5 accidents will happen in the next week?

   **Solution**: 
   - $\lambda = 3$
   - $k = 5$
   
   Using the Poisson formula:
   
   
   $P(X = 5) = \frac{3^5 e^{-3}}{5!} = \frac{243 \cdot e^{-3}}{120} \approx 0.1008$

### **Key Concept Overview:**
In a **Uniform distribution**, each outcome has an equal probability of occurring. The uniform distribution is used when all outcomes in a given range are equally likely.

For a **discrete uniform distribution**, the probability mass function (PMF) is:

$$
P(X = x) = \frac{1}{n}
$$

Where:
- $n$ is the total number of possible outcomes,
- $x$ is any specific outcome.

For a **continuous uniform distribution**, the probability density function (PDF) is:

$$
f(x) = \frac{1}{b - a} \quad \text{for} \quad a \leq x \leq b
$$

Where:
- $a$ and $b$ are the minimum and maximum values of the distribution.

---

### **Example of Discrete Uniform Distribution**:
1. **Question**: A spinner has 6 equal sections numbered from 1 to 6. What is the probability of landing on a number less than 4?

   **Solution**:
   - The total number of possible outcomes $n = 6$.
   - The favorable outcomes are 1, 2, and 3 (i.e., numbers less than 4).
   - The probability of landing on a number less than 4 is:
   
$$
P(X < 4) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
$$

---

### **Example of Continuous Uniform Distribution**:
2. **Question**: A number is randomly selected between 1 and 10. What is the probability that the number is between 3 and 7?

   **Solution**:
   - The total range is from $a = 1$ to $b = 10$.
   - The length of the range where the number can fall (between 3 and 7) is $7 - 3 = 4$.
   - The total length of the distribution is $10 - 1 = 9$.
   - The probability that the number is between 3 and 7 is:

$$
P(3 \leq X \leq 7) = \frac{4}{9}
$$

### **Key Concept Overview:**

In **normal distributions**, the data is symmetrically distributed around the mean, with most of the data points clustering around the mean. The shape of the distribution is a bell curve. The area under the curve represents the total probability and is equal to 1.

The **normal distribution** is defined by two parameters:
- The **mean** ($\mu$) – the average value of the data.
- The **standard deviation** ($\sigma$) – a measure of the spread of the data.

The **empirical rule** (68-95-99.7 rule) states that:
- About 68% of the data falls within 1 standard deviation from the mean.
- About 95% falls within 2 standard deviations.
- About 99.7% falls within 3 standard deviations.

The probability for a specific value can be computed using the **Z-score**, which represents how many standard deviations an element is from the mean. The Z-score is calculated as:

$$
Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}
$$

Where:
- $X$ is the value for which you want to calculate the probability,
- $\mu$ is the mean,
- $\sigma$ is the standard deviation.

### **Example Calculations:**

1. **Question**: A dataset follows a normal distribution with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 5. What is the probability that a randomly selected value is greater than 55?

   **Solution**:
   - Mean $\mu = 50$, Standard Deviation $\sigma = 5$, Value $X = 55$
   - Calculate the Z-score: 
   
$$
Z = \frac{55 - 50}{5} = 1
$$
   
   - Using a standard normal distribution table, the probability that $Z > 1$ is approximately 0.1587.
   
   Therefore, the probability that a randomly selected value is greater than 55 is **0.1587** or about 15.87%.

2. **Question**: The exam scores of students in a class are normally distributed with a mean of 75 and a standard deviation of 8. What is the probability that a student scores below 70 or above 85?

   **Solution**:
   - Mean $\mu = 75$, Standard Deviation $\sigma = 8$, Values $X_1 = 70$ and $X_2 = 85$
   - Calculate Z-scores for both values:
   
$$
Z_1 = \frac{70 - 75}{8} = -0.625, \quad Z_2 = \frac{85 - 75}{8} = 1.25
$$
   
   - Using the standard normal distribution table, the probabilities corresponding to $Z_1 = -0.625$ and $Z_2 = 1.25$ are approximately 0.2660 and 0.8944, respectively.
   - The total probability is the sum of the two areas:
   
$$
P(X < 70 \text{ or } X > 85) = P(Z < -0.625) + P(Z > 1.25) = 0.2660 + (1 - 0.8944) = 0.3716
$$
   
   Therefore, the probability is **0.3716** or about 37.16%.

### **Key Concept Overview:**

The **exponential distribution** is often used to model the time between events in a process where events occur continuously and independently at a constant average rate. The probability density function (PDF) for the exponential distribution is:

$$
f(x|\lambda) = \lambda e^{-\lambda x}, \quad x \geq 0
$$

Where:
- $\lambda = \frac{1}{\mu}$ is the rate parameter, and $\mu$ is the mean (average time between events).
- The **mean** of the distribution is $\mu = \frac{1}{\lambda}$.

The **cumulative distribution function (CDF)** is:

$$
F(x) = 1 - e^{-\lambda x}
$$

Which gives the probability that the event occurs in less than or equal to $x$ time.

### **Probability Calculations:**

- **For a given time $x$**, the probability that the event occurs **after** time $x$ (i.e., $P(X > x)$ is:

$$
P(X > x) = e^{-\lambda x}
$$

- **For a given time interval from $a$ to $b$**, the probability that the event occurs between $a$ and $b$ is:

$$
P(a < X < b) = F(b) - F(a) = (1 - e^{-\lambda b}) - (1 - e^{-\lambda a}) = e^{-\lambda a} - e^{-\lambda b}
$$

---

### **Example Calculation:**

1. **Question**: The time between arrivals at a subway station is exponentially distributed with a mean of 15 minutes. What is the probability that the next arrival will be in more than 20 minutes?

   **Solution**:
   - Mean $\mu = 15$, so $\lambda = \frac{1}{\mu} = \frac{1}{15}$.
   - We are asked for $P(X > 20)$.
   - Using the formula for the exponential distribution:

$$
P(X > 20) = e^{-\lambda \cdot 20} = e^{-\frac{1}{15} \cdot 20} = e^{-\frac{20}{15}} = e^{-1.3333} \approx 0.2636
$$

   Therefore, the probability that the next arrival will be in more than 20 minutes is approximately **0.2636** or **26.36%**.

The key to differentiating between distributions, such as **uniform**, **binomial**, and others like **exponential** or **normal**, lies in understanding the underlying **structure** of the problem and the assumptions we make about the data or experiment. Each distribution has unique characteristics that help you identify which one to apply in a given scenario. Below, I'll outline the key differences and guidance on how to choose the correct distribution for a problem.

---

### **1. Uniform Distribution vs. Binomial Distribution**

#### **Uniform Distribution:**
- **Nature**: The uniform distribution is used when each outcome in a given range has **equal probability**.
- **Typical Scenarios**: Rolling a fair die, selecting a random number from a set of numbers, or picking a point on a line segment (e.g., time between two events).
- **Example**: Rolling a fair die. The probability of rolling any particular number (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6) is the same, i.e., each outcome has a 1/6 chance.
  
  - **Parameters**: It has two parameters, the lower bound $a$ and the upper bound $b$ (e.g., between 1 and 6 for a die).
  - **Use case**: The uniform distribution applies when there is a **single trial** with equally likely outcomes. **No success/failure notion**.

  - **PDF**:
    
$$
f(x) = \frac{1}{b-a} \quad \text{for} \quad a \leq x \leq b
$$

---

#### **Binomial Distribution:**
- **Nature**: The binomial distribution is used when there are **multiple trials** of a binary experiment (success or failure) where each trial is independent.
- **Typical Scenarios**: Rolling a die multiple times and counting how many times a specific outcome (e.g., "rolling a 4") occurs, flipping a coin multiple times.
  
  - **Example**: Rolling a die 10 times and counting how many times you roll a "6." Here, you're dealing with **multiple trials** of the same random experiment (rolling a die).
  - **Parameters**: The binomial distribution has **two parameters**: $n$ (the number of trials) and $p$ (the probability of success on each trial).
  
  - **Use case**: This applies when you are counting the **number of successes** (like rolling a specific number) over multiple trials.
  
  - **PMF** (Probability Mass Function):
    
$$
P(X = k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}
$$

---

### **How to differentiate**:

- **If you are rolling a die once**, and you want to know the probability of rolling a certain number, you would use the **uniform distribution**. There are 6 equally likely outcomes, and no repeated trials.
- **If you are rolling a die multiple times** (e.g., 10 times) and you want to know the probability of a specific number (e.g., rolling a "6" a certain number of times), you would use the **binomial distribution**.

---

### **2. Binomial Distribution vs. Exponential Distribution**

#### **Binomial Distribution**:
- **Nature**: Used for counting the number of **successes** in a fixed number of **independent trials** where each trial has two outcomes (success or failure).
- **Typical Scenarios**: Flipping a coin 10 times and counting how many heads (successes) occur.

  - **Parameters**: Number of trials $n$, probability of success $p$, number of successes $k$.
  - **Example**: The probability of getting exactly 5 heads in 10 flips of a fair coin.

#### **Exponential Distribution**:
- **Nature**: The exponential distribution models the **time between events** in a **Poisson process** where events occur continuously and independently at a constant rate.
- **Typical Scenarios**: Time between arrivals of customers at a store, time between failures of a machine, waiting time in line, etc.
  
  - **Key Characteristic**: The exponential distribution is concerned with **continuous time intervals** between events, not counts of successes or failures. It's often used when you're measuring **time or distance**.
  
  - **Parameters**: The rate parameter $\lambda = 1/\mu$, where $\mu$ is the mean time between events.
  
  - **PDF**:
    
$$
f(x|\lambda) = \lambda e^{-\lambda x}, \quad x \geq 0
$$

---

#### **How to differentiate**:
- **Binomial distribution**: If you are counting the number of **successes** (e.g., heads) in a fixed number of trials (e.g., 10 coin flips), you use the **binomial distribution**.
- **Exponential distribution**: If you are measuring **time** between events, such as the **time between arrivals** or the **time until the next failure**, you use the **exponential distribution**.

---

### **3. Normal Distribution vs. Exponential Distribution**

#### **Normal Distribution**:
- **Nature**: The normal distribution is used when data is **symmetrically distributed** around a mean and follows the **bell curve**. It’s typically used for continuous data that is distributed around a central value.
- **Typical Scenarios**: Heights of people, test scores, measurement errors, or any data where the central limit theorem applies.
  
  - **Parameters**: Mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$.
  - **Use case**: When you’re dealing with **large sample sizes** or **data that is symmetrically distributed**.

#### **Exponential Distribution**:
- **Nature**: The exponential distribution models the **time between events** and is not symmetric—it is **skewed** toward the left. It is used for data where the likelihood of an event occurring decreases as time passes.
  
  - **Use case**: Used for **waiting times**, **failure times**, or time-based measurements where the probability of an event happening decreases as time goes on.

---

#### **How to differentiate**:
- **Normal distribution**: Used when the data is **symmetrically distributed** about the mean and is typically used for measurement data (heights, test scores, etc.).
- **Exponential distribution**: Used when you are measuring **time** between events (such as waiting times), and the distribution is **not symmetric** but rather **skewed**.

---

### **4. Poisson Distribution vs. Exponential Distribution**

#### **Poisson Distribution**:
- **Nature**: The Poisson distribution is used to model the **count** of events that happen within a **fixed interval** of time or space. It’s a discrete distribution.
- **Typical Scenarios**: Counting the number of cars passing through a toll booth in one hour, the number of calls received by a call center in a day, etc.

  - **Parameters**: The rate parameter $\lambda$, which is the expected number of events in the interval.
  - **Use case**: When you are **counting the number of events** (e.g., number of arrivals, failures, calls).

#### **Exponential Distribution**:
- **Nature**: The exponential distribution models the **time between events** in a **Poisson process**. It is **continuous**.
- **Typical Scenarios**: Measuring the time between arrivals, time until a machine breaks down, etc.
  
  - **Use case**: When you are interested in the **time** between events, rather than the **count** of events.

---

#### **How to differentiate**:
- **Poisson distribution**: Use the **Poisson distribution** when you're **counting the number of events** in a fixed time or space interval (e.g., number of accidents at a traffic intersection in a year).
- **Exponential distribution**: Use the **exponential distribution** when you're measuring **time** between events (e.g., time between customer arrivals).

---

### **Summary of Key Differences**

| **Distribution** | **Key Characteristics**                         | **Use Case**                                             |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Uniform**      | Equal probability for all outcomes within a range | Single trial, equally likely outcomes (e.g., rolling a fair die) |
| **Binomial**     | Fixed number of trials, each with two outcomes   | Multiple trials, count of successes (e.g., number of heads in coin flips) |
| **Exponential**  | Time between events in a Poisson process         | Time between events (e.g., time until the next failure)  |
| **Normal**       | Symmetric, bell-shaped distribution              | Symmetric data (e.g., heights, test scores)               |
| **Poisson**      | Count of events in fixed intervals               | Count of events over time or space (e.g., number of arrivals) |

---

- **Uniform**: Equal likelihood for each outcome in a range (single trial, no successes/failures).
- **Binomial**: Counting successes in multiple trials (fixed number of trials).
- **Exponential**: Time between events (continuous data).
- **Normal**: Symmetric data centered around a mean.
- **Poisson**: Counting events in a fixed interval (count of events).
