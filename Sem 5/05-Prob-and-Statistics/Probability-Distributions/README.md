## Binomial

1. To find the probability of rolling exactly two 3's in 5 rolls of a single die, what is wrong with the strategy of using the multiplication rule to find the probability of getting two 3's, followed by three non-3's, which is given by
2. Determine if the following situations suggest a random variable with a binomial distribution:

- The number of questions correct if one randomly guesses on a quiz of 20 multiple choice questions where each question has 4 possible answers
- The number of people with blue eyes in a group of 10 people drawn from a room of 30 people without replacement.
- The number of bird chirps one can hear in a day if the average number of chirps per hour is 15.
- The number of heads seen in 30 flips of a coin
- The number of each of 3 species of flowers present in a collection of 100 flowers.
- The number of rolls of two dice that result in a prime total if the dice are rolled 50 times.
- The number of 400 subjects taking Atorvastatin that indicated they experienced a headache the same day they first took this drug.

3. For each random variable below that follows a binomial distribution corresponding to the given number of trials `n`, and probability of success `p`, find the probability of seeing `x` successes.

4. About 8% of males are colorblind. A researcher needs three colorblind men for an experiment and begins checking potential subjects. What is the probability that she finds three or more colorblind men in the first nine she examines?
5. Assume that 13% of people are left-handed. If we select 5 people at random, find the probability of each outcome below:
- The first lefty is the fifth person chosen
- There are exactly 3 lefties in the group
- There are some lefties among the 5 people
- There are no more than 3 lefties in the group


6. A six sided die is rolled 12 times. What is the probability of getting a 4 five times?
7. A multiple choice test contains 20 questions with answer choices A, B, C, and D. Only one answer choice to each question represents a correct answer. Find the probability that a student will answer exactly 6 questions correct if he makes random guesses on all 20 questions.
8. 3. 25% of all students enrolled in high school XYZ are taking Algebra. 30 students are chosen at random. (a) Find the probability that exactly 7 students out of the 30 chosen are taking Algebra. (b) What is the probability that fewer than 5 students out of the 30 who are selected are taking Algebra? (c) Calculate the mean and standard deviation of this binomial distribution.



## Poisson
1. Assume a Poisson distribution is involved and use the mean `(i.e., Î»)` provided to find the indicated probability.

2. Over the course of 365 days, 1 million radioactive atoms of Cesium-137 decayed to 977,287 radioactive atoms. Use the Poisson distribution to estimate the probability that on a given day, 50 radioactive atoms decayed. 
3. In the last 100 years, there have been 93 earthquakes measuring 6.0 or more on the Richter scale. What is the probability of having 3 earthquakes in the same year that all measure 6.0 or more?
4. A small business receives, on average, 12 customers per day. (a) What is the probability that the business will
receive exactly 8 customers in one day?
5. A student receives, on average, 7 text messages in a 2 hour period? (a) What is the probability that the student will receive exactly 9 text messages in a 2 hour period? (b) What is the probability that the student will receive exactly 24 text messages in an 8 hour period?
6. A small business receives, on average, 8 calls per hour. (a) What is the probability that the business will receive exactly 7 calls in 1 hour? (b) What is the probability that the business will receive, at most, 5 calls in one hour? (c) What is the probability that the business will receive more than 6 calls in one hour?


## Uniform
