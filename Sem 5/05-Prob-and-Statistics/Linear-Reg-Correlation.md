The **coefficient of correlation** and the **coefficient of determination** are related statistical concepts, but they represent different things.

### 1. **Coefficient of Correlation (r)**:
- **Definition**: The coefficient of correlation measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables.
- **Range**: $-1 \leq r \leq 1$, where:
  - $r = 1$ indicates a perfect positive linear relationship,
  - $r = -1$ indicates a perfect negative linear relationship,
  - $r = 0$ indicates no linear relationship.
- **Formula**:
  
$$
r = \frac{\sum (X_i - \bar{X})(Y_i - \bar{Y})}{\sqrt{\sum (X_i - \bar{X})^2 \sum (Y_i - \bar{Y})^2}}
$$

  where:
  - $X_i$ and $Y_i$ are the individual data points,
  - $\bar{X}$ and $\bar{Y}$ are the means of the variables $X$ and $Y$.

### 2. **Coefficient of Determination (r²)**:
- **Definition**: The coefficient of determination is the square of the coefficient of correlation and represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable.
- **Range**: $0 \leq r^2 \leq 1$, where:
  - $r^2 = 1$ means that 100% of the variation in the dependent variable can be explained by the independent variable.
  - $r^2 = 0$ means that no variation can be explained.
- **Formula**:

$$
r^2 = \left( \frac{\sum (X_i - \bar{X})(Y_i - \bar{Y})}{\sqrt{\sum (X_i - \bar{X})^2 \sum (Y_i - \bar{Y})^2}} \right)^2
$$
  
or simply $r^2 = r^2$, where $r$ is the correlation coefficient.

### Key Differences:
- **r** indicates the strength and direction of the relationship.
- **r²** tells you how much of the variance in one variable can be explained by the other variable.

The formulas for the **coefficient of correlation** and **coefficient of determination** can also be written in a more compact form that includes the sample size $n$, which is often used in practice for convenience. Here’s the alternative form:

### 1. **Coefficient of Correlation (r)**:
The formula for the coefficient of correlation, including the sample size $n$, is:

$$
r = \frac{n \sum X_i Y_i - \sum X_i \sum Y_i}{\sqrt{\left( n \sum X_i^2 - (\sum X_i)^2 \right) \left( n \sum Y_i^2 - (\sum Y_i)^2 \right)}}
$$

Where:
- $n$ is the number of data points,
- $X_i$ and $Y_i$ are the individual data points,
- $\sum X_i$ and $\sum Y_i$ are the sums of the $X$ and $Y$ values, respectively,
- $\sum X_i^2$ and $\sum Y_i^2$ are the sums of the squared values of $X$ and $Y$, respectively.

### 2. **Coefficient of Determination (r²)**:
The coefficient of determination is simply the square of the correlation coefficient:

$$
r^2 = \left( \frac{n \sum X_i Y_i - \sum X_i \sum Y_i}{\sqrt{\left( n \sum X_i^2 - (\sum X_i)^2 \right) \left( n \sum Y_i^2 - (\sum Y_i)^2 \right)}} \right)^2
$$

Alternatively, since $r^2$ is the square of $r$, you can also directly compute it as:

$$
r^2 = r \times r
$$

This shows how much of the variance in $Y$ can be explained by $X$. 

### Summary:
- The **correlation coefficient $r$** measures the direction and strength of the relationship.
- The **coefficient of determination $r^2$** quantifies the proportion of the variance explained by the relationship between the variables.
