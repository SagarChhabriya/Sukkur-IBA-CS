## Parameter vs Statistic | Definitions, Differences & Examples

A parameter is a number describing a whole population (e.g., population mean), while a statistic is a number describing a sample (e.g., sample mean).<br>
The goal of quantitative research is to understand characteristics of populations by finding parameters. In practice, itâ€™s often too difficult, time-consuming or unfeasible to collect data from every member of a population. Instead, data is collected from samples.<br>
With inferential statistics, we can use sample statistics to make educated guesses about population parameters.
