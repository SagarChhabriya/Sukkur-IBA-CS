## Parameter vs Statistic | Definitions, Differences & Examples

- A parameter is a number describing a whole population (e.g., population mean), while a statistic is a number describing a sample (e.g., sample mean).<br>
- The goal of quantitative research is to understand characteristics of populations by finding parameters. In practice, it’s often too difficult, time-consuming or unfeasible to collect data from every member of a population. Instead, data is collected from samples.<br>
- With inferential statistics, we can use sample statistics to make educated guesses about population parameters.

## Population vs sample
- Population vs sampleIn research, a population is the entire group that you’re interested in studying. This may be a group of people (e.g., all adults in the US or all employees of a company), but it can also mean a group containing other kinds of elements: objects, events, organizations, countries, species, organisms, etc.

- A sample is a smaller group taken from the population. The sample is the group of elements that you will actually collect data from.


## What kinds of numbers are parameters and statistics?
- Statistics and parameters are numbers that summarize any measurable characteristic of a sample or a population.

- For `categorical` variables (e.g., political affiliation), the most common statistic or parameter is a `proportion`.

- For `numerical` variables (e.g., height), the `mean` or `standard deviation` are commonly reported statistics or parameters.

| Standard deviation of weights of avocados from one farm.                | Standard deviation of weights of all avocados in the region.             |

## Statistical notation
- Different symbols are used for statistics versus parameters to show whether a sample or a population is being referred to.

- Greek letters and capital letters usually refer to populations, whereas Latin letters and lower-case letters refer to samples.

|                         | Sample Statistic        | Population Parameter    |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| Proportion              | p̂ (called “p-hat”)     | P                       |
| Mean                    | x̄ (called “x-bar”)     | μ (Greek letter “mu”)   |
| Standard deviation      | s (Latin letter “s”)    | σ (Greek letter “sigma”)|
| Variance                | s²                      | σ²                      |



## Telling the Difference Between a Parameter and a Statistic

In news and research reports, it’s not always clear whether a number is a parameter or statistic. To figure out which type of number you’re dealing with, ask yourself the following:

1. **Does the number describe a whole, complete population where every member can be reached for data collection?**
2. **Is it possible to collect data on this characteristic from every member of the population in a reasonable time frame?**

- If the answer is **yes** to both questions, the number is likely to be a **parameter**. For small populations, data can be collected from the whole population and summarized in parameters.

- If the answer is **no** to either of the questions, then the number is more likely to be a **statistic**. Sampling is used to collect data from large populations and generalize the statistics to the broader population in an externally valid way.


## Estimating Parameters from Statistics

Using inferential statistics, you can estimate population parameters from sample statistics. To make unbiased estimates, your sample should ideally be representative of your population and/or randomly selected.

### Types of Estimates

There are two important types of estimates you can make about the population parameter: point estimates and interval estimates.

- **`Point Estimate`** A point estimate is a `single value` estimate of a parameter based on a statistic. For instance, a sample mean is a point estimate of a population mean.
- **`Interval Estimate`** An interval estimate gives you a `range of values` where the parameter is expected to lie. A `confidence interval` is the most common type of interval estimate.

`Tip` An estimate refers to using data from a sample to make an educated guess about a population parameter.

Both types of estimates are important for gathering a clear idea of where a parameter is likely to lie.

### Estimating a Population Parameter from a Sample Statistic

In your study on support for the death penalty among US residents, you find that 61% of participants in your sample support the death penalty. To estimate the population parameter, you calculate a point estimate and an interval estimate from your sample statistic.

- **Point Estimate**: Your point estimate is your sample statistic – you estimate that 61% of all US residents support the death penalty.

- **Interval Estimate**: To find the interval estimate, you construct a 95% confidence interval that tells you where the population parameter is expected to lie most of the time. With random sampling, there is a 0.95 probability that the true population parameter for support for the death penalty among US residents lies between 57% and 65%.
