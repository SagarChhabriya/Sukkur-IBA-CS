### **Medium Questions:**

6. **Question 6:**  
   In a One-Way ANOVA, if the F-statistic calculated is 4.5 and the critical F-value at a significance level of 0.05 is 3.9, what is your conclusion regarding the null hypothesis?

7. **Question 7:**  
   A study was conducted on the effect of three types of teaching methods on student performance. The null hypothesis for the One-Way ANOVA is that the means of all three groups are equal. If the p-value from the One-Way ANOVA is 0.03, what do you conclude about the means of the teaching methods?

   **Data:**

   | Teaching Method | Test Scores |
   |-----------------|-------------|
   | Method 1        | 75          |
   | Method 1        | 78          |
   | Method 1        | 80          |
   | Method 2        | 85          |
   | Method 2        | 87          |
   | Method 2        | 86          |
   | Method 3        | 90          |
   | Method 3        | 92          |
   | Method 3        | 91          |

8. **Question 8:**  
   A researcher conducted a One-Way ANOVA and found an F-statistic of 1.8 with a corresponding p-value of 0.12. What is the interpretation of the p-value in this case?

9. **Question 9:**  
   What is the purpose of calculating the "Sum of Squares Between Groups (SSB)" in One-Way ANOVA?

10. **Question 10:**  
    You are performing a One-Way ANOVA with 5 groups. You have calculated the Sum of Squares Between Groups (SSB) as 150, and the degrees of freedom for Between Groups (df_between) as 4. What is the Mean Square Between Groups (MSB)?

### **Hard Questions:**

11. **Question 11:**  
    A company is comparing the effectiveness of three different diets on weight loss. The One-Way ANOVA results show an F-statistic of 3.5 with 2 degrees of freedom for the numerator and 27 degrees of freedom for the denominator. At a 0.05 significance level, do you reject the null hypothesis?

12. **Question 12:**  
    In a One-Way ANOVA with 6 groups, the Sum of Squares Between Groups (SSB) is 240 and the Sum of Squares Within Groups (SSW) is 180. If there are 36 observations in total, calculate the F-statistic.
