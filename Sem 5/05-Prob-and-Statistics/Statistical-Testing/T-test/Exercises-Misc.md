### Question 1 (***) - Hypothesis Testing

The continuous random variables $X$ and $Y$ follow the distributions:

- $X \sim N(\mu_x, 4)$
- $Y \sim N(\mu_y, 6)$

A random sample of 10 observations of $X$ yields a sample mean of 34.6, while a random sample of 15 observations of $Y$ yields a sample mean of 32.0.

You are tasked with conducting a hypothesis test at the 5% significance level to determine if there is sufficient evidence to conclude that the mean of $X$ is greater than the mean of $Y$.

### Question 2 (***) - Hypothesis Testing

The continuous random variables $X_1$ and $X_2$ satisfy the following distributions:

- $X_1 \sim N(\mu_1, 20)$
- $X_2 \sim N(\mu_2, 40)$

A random sample of 5 observations of $X_1$ produced a sample mean of 157. A random sample of 5 observations of $X_2$ produced a sample mean of 187.

A test is to be carried out to determine whether there is evidence that the mean of $X_1$ is different from the mean of $X_2$.

Carry out the test at the 5% significance level.

### Question 3 (***) - Hypothesis Testing

The same Mathematics mock exam is given to the Year 11 students of a certain school year after year. It has been established over time that the standard deviation of the marks is 9 for the boys and 6 for the girls. The marks for both boys and girls are thought to be normally distributed.

The marks of 9 boys in this year’s mock exam had a mean of 74, while the marks of 16 girls in the same exam had a mean of 68.

The Head of Maths believes that, in this academic year, the Year 11 boys have a higher mean mark than that of the Year 11 girls.

Test, at the 5% level of significance, whether the claim of the Head of Maths is justified. State your hypotheses clearly, stating any additional assumptions made.

### Question 4 (***) - Hypothesis Testing

It has been established over time that the javelin throwing distances of an athlete are normally distributed with a standard deviation of 8 m.

Ten throws of this athlete in the previous year had a mean of 62.59 m. Five throws of this athlete this year had a mean of 71.06 m.

Test at the 2.5% level of significance whether the mean throwing distances of the athlete have improved this year. 

State your hypotheses clearly, stating any additional assumptions made.

### Question 5 (***) - Hypothesis Testing

It has been established over time that the javelin throwing distances of an athlete have a standard deviation of 10.44 m.

Sixty throws of this athlete in the previous year had a mean distance of 68.54 m. Forty throws of the same athlete during this year produced a mean distance of 72.57 m.

Assuming the throws considered in each year are random, test at the 2% level of significance whether the mean throwing distances of the athlete have changed since last year. 

State your hypotheses clearly, stating any additional assumptions made.

### Question 6 (***) - Hypothesis Testing

The hardness of a certain type of rock is a Normal variable with a standard deviation of 35, measured in suitable units.

Eight rock samples were collected from a certain area A and a further six rock samples were collected from a different area B. These samples were randomly collected, and their hardness was accurately tested, recorded (in suitable units), and summarized below:

- **Area A**: 1156, 1280, 1199, 1220, 1175, 1204, 1246, 1168.
- **Area B**: 1175, 1143, 1159, 1142, 1224, 1147.

Test, at the 5% level of significance, whether there is a difference in the mean hardness of this type of rock in the two areas from where these samples were collected.

### Question 7 (**+*) - Hypothesis Testing

The same Mathematics mock exam is given to the Year 11 students of a certain school year after year. It has been established over time that the standard deviation of the marks is 10 for the boys and 8 for the girls. The marks for both boys and girls are thought to be normally distributed.

The marks of 5 boys in this year’s mock exam had a mean of 64, while the marks of 5 girls in the same test had a mean of 78.

The Head of Maths thinks that, in this academic year, the mean mark of the Year 11 girls is at least 5 marks higher than that of the Year 11 boys.

Test, at the 5% level of significance, whether the claim of the Head of Maths is justified. State your hypotheses clearly, stating any additional assumptions made.

### Question 8 (**+*) - Hypothesis Testing

The continuous random variables $X_1$ and $X_2$ satisfy the following distributions:

- $X_1 \sim N(\mu_1, 50)$
- $X_2 \sim N(\mu_2, 20)$

A random sample of 40 observations of $X_1$ produced a sample mean of 1752.

A random sample of 50 observations of $X_2$ produced a sample mean of 1598.

A test is to be carried out to determine whether there is evidence that the mean of $X_1$ is greater than the mean of $X_2$ by more than 140.

Carry out the test at the 10% significance level.

### Question 9 (**+*) - Hypothesis Testing

A group of 1200 soldiers completed an assault course early in the morning. A random sample of 60 soldiers was selected from the group of 1200. The time taken by each of these 60 soldiers to complete the assault course, $x$ minutes, was recorded and the following information is known:

- $\sum_{i=1}^{60} x_i = 1350$
- $\sum_{i=1}^{60} x_i^2 = 30685$

**(a)** Find unbiased estimates for the mean and variance of the time taken by the 1200 soldiers who completed the course early in the morning.

A group of 1500 soldiers completed the same assault course late in the afternoon. A random sample of 60 soldiers was selected from the group of 1500. The time taken by each of these 60 soldiers to complete the assault course, $y$ minutes, was recorded and the following information is known:

- $\bar{y} = 24.1$ (Sample mean)
- $s_y^2 = 5.48$ (Sample variance)

**(b)** Test, at the 5% significance level, whether or not the mean time of the 1500 soldiers who completed the assault course in the afternoon is greater than that of the 1200 soldiers who completed the same course in the morning.

State the hypotheses clearly and any assumptions and validations made.

### Question 10 (****) - Hypothesis Testing

The continuous random variables $X$ and $Y$ are defined as:

- $X \sim N(\mu_x, 2)$
- $Y \sim N(\mu_y, 3)$

The mean of a random sample of 7 observations from the population of $X$ is denoted by $\bar{x}$, and the mean of a random sample of 9 observations from the population of $Y$ is denoted by $\bar{y}$.

A test on the difference of the population means, at the 5% significance level, is to be carried out.

**(a)** Stating your hypotheses clearly, determine the critical region for this test.  
Give the answer in the form $x - y > k$, where $k$ is a constant.

**(b)** Determine the probability of a Type II error if $\mu_x = \mu_y + 0.9$.
