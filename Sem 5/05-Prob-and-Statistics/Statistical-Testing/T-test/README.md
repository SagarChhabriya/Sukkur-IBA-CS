## T-test

The t-test formula helps us to compare the average values of two data sets and determine if they belong to the same population or are they different. The t-score is compared with the critical value obtained from the t-table. The large t-score indicates that the groups are different and a small t-score indicates that the groups are similar.


### What Is the T-test Formula?
The t-test formula is applied to the sample population. The t-test formula depends on the mean, variance, and standard deviation of the data being compared. There are 3 types of t-tests that could be performed on the n number of samples collected.

- One-sample test,
- Independent sample t-test and
- Paired samples t-test

The critical value is obtained from the t-table looking for the degree of freedom(df = n-1) and the corresponding Î± value(usually 0.05 or 0.1). If the t-test obtained statistically > CV then the initial hypothesis is wrong and we conclude that the results are significantly different.
