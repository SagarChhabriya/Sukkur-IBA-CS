## **Internet**
The internet is a global network that connects millions of computers, allowing them to communicate and share data. It is a vast and decentralized system that allows for the exchange of information using standard communication protocols, such as TCP/IP.

### **Example:**
- When you browse a website or send an email, your data is transmitted over the internet from one computer to another via a series of routers and servers.

---

## **Network Edge**
The network edge refers to the devices and systems that exist at the boundary of a network, typically at the point where users connect to the network. This includes devices like routers, access points, and user devices like computers or smartphones.

### **Example:**
- A Wi-Fi router in your home is part of the network edge, providing internet access to your devices.

---

## **Network Core**
The network core is the central part of a network where the major data routing and switching occur. It includes high-capacity routers and switches that interconnect different parts of the network, handling the transmission of data across long distances.

### **Example:**
- The internet backbone is made up of large, high-speed fiber optic cables and routers that connect different ISPs and data centers around the world.

---

## **Delays, Loss, and Throughput**
These are key metrics for measuring the performance of a network:

1. **Delays**: The time it takes for data to travel from the source to the destination. Delays can be caused by various factors such as distance, network congestion, and processing delays at routers.
   
2. **Loss**: Refers to dropped packets during transmission. Packet loss occurs when routers or devices cannot process or forward data due to congestion or errors.

3. **Throughput**: The amount of data successfully delivered over the network in a given time period, often measured in bits per second (bps).

### **Example:**
- High throughput with minimal delays and packet loss is desired for applications like video streaming or online gaming.

---

## **OSI Stack**
The **OSI (Open Systems Interconnection)** model is a conceptual framework used to understand and design network systems by splitting network communication into seven layers:

1. **Physical Layer**: Deals with the physical transmission of data (e.g., cables, signals).
2. **Data Link Layer**: Ensures reliable data transfer over the physical link.
3. **Network Layer**: Handles routing of data across networks (e.g., IP addresses).
4. **Transport Layer**: Ensures end-to-end communication (e.g., TCP/UDP).
5. **Session Layer**: Manages sessions or connections between applications.
6. **Presentation Layer**: Formats data for the application layer (e.g., encryption, compression).
7. **Application Layer**: Provides network services to applications (e.g., HTTP, FTP).

---

## **Network Under Attack**
Network attacks refer to various malicious activities that disrupt or damage a network. These can include:

1. **Denial of Service (DoS)**: An attack that floods a server with traffic, making it unavailable to users.
2. **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)**: A hacker intercepts and potentially alters communication between two parties.
3. **Phishing**: Deceptive attempts to steal personal information by impersonating legitimate services.

### **Example:**
- Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks can overwhelm a web server, causing it to crash and become inaccessible.

---

## **Evolution of the Internet**
The internet has evolved from its origins as ARPANET (a military project) into a global network supporting various applications, including email, websites, and e-commerce. Major milestones include the development of TCP/IP, the World Wide Web, and broadband technologies.

### **Example:**
- In the early days of the internet, users had to dial up through a phone line using modems. Today, high-speed fiber and 5G networks offer much faster internet connections.

---

## **Application Layer**
The **Application Layer** is the topmost layer of the OSI model, responsible for providing network services directly to end-users. It defines protocols and data formats used by applications such as web browsers, email clients, and file transfer tools.

### **Examples:**
- **HTTP**: Used by web browsers to request and display web pages.
- **FTP**: A protocol for transferring files between a client and server.
- **SMTP**: A protocol for sending emails.

---

## **Web and HTTP**
The **Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)** is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web. It defines how messages are formatted and transmitted, and how web servers and browsers should respond to various commands.

### **Example:**
- When you type a website URL into your browser, the browser sends an HTTP request to the server, which then responds with the requested webpage.

---

## **FTP (File Transfer Protocol)**
**FTP** is a standard network protocol used to transfer files between a client and a server over a TCP/IP network. FTP operates on two channels: one for commands and one for data transfer.

### **Example:**
- FTP is commonly used to upload files to a web server.

---

## **SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)**
**SMTP** is the protocol used to send emails from one server to another. It is a push protocol that works by transferring email messages from the sending mail server to the receiving mail server.

### **Example:**
- When you send an email through your email client (e.g., Outlook or Gmail), SMTP is used to transmit the email to the mail server.

---

## **DNS (Domain Name System)**
**DNS** is a system that translates human-readable domain names (e.g., www.example.com) into IP addresses (e.g., 192.168.1.1), enabling computers to locate each other over the internet.

### **Example:**
- When you enter a website URL, your browser queries the DNS server to find the corresponding IP address for that domain.

---

## **P2P (Peer-to-Peer)**
**P2P** refers to a decentralized network model in which each node (peer) in the network can act as both a client and a server. P2P networks are commonly used for file sharing, VoIP (Voice over IP) applications, and cryptocurrency networks.

### **Example:**
- BitTorrent is a popular P2P file-sharing protocol.

---

## **Transport Layer**
The **Transport Layer** in the OSI model ensures that data is transferred reliably between hosts. It provides error detection, retransmission of lost data, and proper sequencing of data.

### **Example:**
- **TCP** (Transmission Control Protocol) provides reliable, connection-oriented communication, while **UDP** (User Datagram Protocol) offers faster but unreliable communication.

---

## **Connectionless - UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**
**UDP** is a transport layer protocol that allows for data transmission without establishing a connection. Unlike TCP, it does not ensure data delivery, making it suitable for real-time applications where speed is more important than reliability.

### **Example:**
- **Streaming video or audio** often uses UDP because it prioritizes low latency over error-free transmission.

---

## **Reliable Data Transfer**
Reliable data transfer ensures that data is accurately transmitted between sender and receiver without errors. **TCP** guarantees this by using mechanisms like error checking, retransmission, and acknowledgment.

### **Example:**
- When you download a file over the internet, TCP ensures that all parts of the file are received correctly.

---

## **Connection-Oriented TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**
**TCP** is a connection-oriented protocol that establishes a connection between the sender and receiver before data is transmitted. It ensures that data is sent reliably, in the correct order, and without errors.

### **Example:**
- When you load a webpage, TCP ensures that all data (HTML, images, etc.) is transferred correctly to your browser.

---

## **Overview of Congestion Control**
**Congestion control** refers to techniques used to manage network traffic and prevent network congestion. It is an important part of TCP, which adjusts the rate of data transmission based on network conditions.

### **Example:**
- TCP uses algorithms like **Slow Start** and **Congestion Avoidance** to avoid overwhelming the network with too much data.

---

## **Network Layer**
The **Network Layer** is responsible for routing data between devices on different networks. It defines logical addressing (e.g., IP addresses) and handles packet forwarding across networks.

### **Example:**
- **IP routing** ensures that data packets reach the correct destination by passing through routers in the network.

---

## **IPv4 and IPv6**
**IPv4** is the fourth version of the Internet Protocol, which uses 32-bit addresses. **IPv6**, the successor to IPv4, uses 128-bit addresses to accommodate the growing number of devices connected to the internet.

### **Example:**
- **IPv4** addresses look like `192.168.1.1`, while **IPv6** addresses are much longer, e.g., `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`.

---

## **Routing in Internet**
**Routing** refers to the process of determining the path that data takes from the source to the destination across the internet. Routers use routing tables and protocols (e.g., BGP) to forward packets.

### **Example:**
- Routers direct packets of data to different networks and paths to avoid congestion and ensure they reach their final destination.

---

## **Link Layer**
The **Link Layer** is responsible for the communication between devices on the same network. It handles the physical transmission of data and error detection/correction within the same local network.

### **Example:**
- **Ethernet** is a common link-layer protocol used to connect devices within a Local Area Network (LAN).

---

## **MPLS (Multiprotocol Label Switching)**
**MPLS** is a technology used in high-performance networks to forward data packets based on labels rather than IP addresses. It allows for efficient data transmission and improved bandwidth utilization.

### **Example:**
- Telecom companies use MPLS to route traffic through private networks with guaranteed quality of service (QoS).
