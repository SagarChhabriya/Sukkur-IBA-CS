# Chapter 6 Choice of Legal Strcuture

### 6.1 Introduction

Building a technology venture often requires a team. While a founder (or inventor) may come up with the idea, they typically need to recruit others to provide skills, expertise, or credibility to make the business viable. These individuals may be offered equity in the company instead of full compensation, especially in start-ups where cash is limited. The equity given depends on each person's contribution to the venture.

The decisions made at the founding stage—such as the legal structure and how equity is distributed—are critical for attracting investors and co-venturers, as well as for ensuring the venture’s financial success.

### 6.2 OWNERSHIP AND LIABILITY ISSUES

A start-up is usually owned by one or more individuals or entities, called founders, who contribute to the business in exchange for equity (ownership). Later contributors are referred to as investors or lenders. In the U.S., a business can take several legal forms, such as:

- Sole proprietorship
- General partnership
- Limited partnership (LP)
- Limited liability company (LLC)
- Corporation (C-corporation or S-corporation)

Other structures like cooperatives or nonprofits also exist but are generally based on one of the above types. The choice of structure impacts the business in various ways, including the risk to owners, growth potential, available benefits, taxation, and exit strategies. One key factor is the liability of the owners, with some structures offering limited liability and others not.

### 6.2.1 Limited Versus Unlimited Liability

1. **Unlimited Liability**: 
   - Owners are personally responsible for all business debts and obligations.
   - *Example*: In a sole proprietorship, the owner is personally liable for all debts, such as paying off a business loan even if the business fails.

2. **Limited Liability**: 
   - Owners' liability is limited to the amount they invest in the business, protecting personal assets.
   - *Example*: In an LLC, if the business goes into debt, the owner's personal assets (like their house) are protected from being used to pay the company's debts.

3. **Corporation (C-Corp & S-Corp)**:
   - A legal entity separate from its owners, offering limited liability protection.
   - *Example*: In a corporation, shareholders are only responsible for the amount they invested in stock, not the company’s debt.

4. **Limited Liability Company (LLC)**:
   - A hybrid entity that combines the limited liability of a corporation with the tax benefits of a partnership.
   - *Example*: In an LLC, if the business is sued, the owner's personal assets are protected, and the profits are only taxed once.

5. **Limited Partnership (LP)**:
   - A business with at least one general partner (unlimited liability) and one or more limited partners (limited liability).
   - *Example*: In an LP, the general partner runs the business and has unlimited liability, while the limited partners invest money but are not responsible for business debts beyond their investment.


### 6.2.2 The Extent of Limited Liability

1. **Limited Liability Protection**:
   - Owners are generally not personally responsible for business debts if the business is properly formed and managed.
   - **Example**: If a limited liability company (LLC) cannot pay its bills, the owner’s personal assets (house, car) are protected from creditors.

2. **Piercing the Corporate Veil**:
   - Personal liability can occur if the business fails to meet legal requirements, engages in fraudulent activities, or mixes personal and business assets.
   - **Example**: If an LLC owner uses company funds to pay for personal expenses or doesn't keep separate business records, they may be personally liable for business debts.

3. **Legal Compliance**:
   - Owners may be held personally liable for unpaid taxes, environmental violations, or other statutory obligations.
   - **Example**: A business owner could be personally liable for unpaid payroll taxes, even if the business is an LLC, if taxes are not properly filed.

### 6.3 Choice of Legal Structure

1. **Risks and Liabilities**:
   - Limited liability entities protect owners by shielding their personal assets from business debts and liabilities.
   - **Example**: In an LLC, the owner's personal savings are protected even if the business faces financial trouble.

2. **Capital Growth Needs**:
   - Some business structures are better suited to raising significant capital from multiple investors.
   - **Example**: A corporation is more suitable for raising large amounts of capital through issuing stocks, unlike a sole proprietorship.

3. **Tax Implications**:
   - Different business entities have varying tax consequences based on structure and jurisdiction.
   - **Example**: A corporation may face double taxation (on profits and dividends), whereas an LLC may offer pass-through taxation, where profits are only taxed once.


# 6.3.1 Sole Proprietorship

A **sole proprietorship** is the simplest form of business. It is created when an individual owns and operates a business without following formal entity creation processes. The business is not legally separate from the owner, and the owner is personally responsible for all debts, liabilities, and obligations.

### Key Points:
- **Ownership & Management**: Owned and managed by one individual (or a married couple for tax purposes).
- **Taxation**: The business's income is reported on the owner's personal tax return and taxed at the personal rate. The owner is also subject to self-employment taxes.
- **Formation**: Simple to set up, requiring minimal formalities like fictitious name registration and necessary business licenses.
- **Liability**: The owner has unlimited personal liability for business debts and employee actions.

### Advantages:
- **Simplicity and Low Cost**: Easy to establish with minimal formalities.
- **Complete Control**: The owner has full decision-making authority.
- **Pass-through Taxation**: Income and losses are reported on the owner's personal return.

### Disadvantages:
- **Unlimited Liability**: Personal assets are at risk for business obligations.
- **Limited Capital Raising**: The business relies solely on the owner's resources.
- **Self-employment Taxes**: The owner must pay self-employment taxes on business income.

A sole proprietorship is ideal for small businesses with minimal risks but comes with the downside of unlimited liability.


# 6.3.2 General Partnership

A **general partnership** is formed when profits and losses are shared by two or more individuals or entities. It is considered a partnership unless statutory entity formalities are followed. In a general partnership, each partner has unlimited personal liability for the business's debts and obligations.

### Key Points:
- **Ownership & Management**: Typically defined by a partnership agreement. In the absence of an agreement, partners have equal say in management.
- **Liability**: Partners are jointly and severally liable, meaning each partner can be held responsible for the entire business debt.
- **Taxation**: The business does not pay taxes directly. Instead, income, losses, and gains pass through to partners and are taxed at the individual level.
- **Formation**: Formed by an agreement between partners (either oral or written). A partnership can also be formed by representing the business as such to the public.

### Advantages:
- **Simplicity**: Easy to form and manage with minimal formalities.
- **Flexibility**: Partners can decide profit distribution and management roles.
- **Pass-through Taxation**: Income, gains, and losses pass through to partners, avoiding double taxation.

### Disadvantages:
- **Unlimited Liability**: Partners are personally responsible for the debts and obligations of the business.
- **Vicarious Liability**: Partners are liable for each other's actions.
- **Self-employment Taxes**: Partners must pay self-employment taxes on their share of the business income.

A general partnership is suitable for businesses where multiple parties want to share profits and responsibilities but it comes with significant liability risks.


# 6.3.3 Limited Partnership

A **Limited Partnership (LP)** consists of one or more general partners and one or more limited partners. It is created by filing a certificate of LP with the state and establishing a limited partnership agreement.

### Key Points:
- **General Partners**: Responsible for managing the business and are personally liable for the partnership’s debts.
- **Limited Partners**: Passive investors with liability limited to their investment. Any active involvement may convert them into general partners.
- **Liability**: General partners have unlimited liability, while limited partners' liability is restricted to their investment.
- **Management**: Managed by general partners. Limited partners cannot take part in management without risking their limited liability status.
- **Taxation**: Profits and losses pass through to partners and are taxed at the individual level, whether or not profits are distributed.

### Advantages:
- **Limited Liability for Limited Partners**: Limited partners' personal assets are protected beyond their investment.
- **Flexibility**: Tailored management and profit-sharing arrangements.
- **Pass-through Taxation**: No double taxation as income is taxed at the individual level.

### Disadvantages:
- **Unlimited Liability for General Partners**: General partners are fully responsible for business debts.
- **Limited Management Rights**: Limited partners cannot participate in day-to-day management.
- **Self-employment Taxes**: General partners may be subject to self-employment taxes.

An LP is suitable for ventures where passive investors want to limit their risk while providing active partners with management control.

# 6.3.4 Corporation

A **Corporation** is a legal entity separate from its owners, created under state law. Corporations are formed by filing articles of incorporation (or charter) with a government agency. 

### Structure:
- **Board of Directors**: Responsible for oversight and fiduciary duties to shareholders.
- **Officers**: Manage day-to-day operations.
- **Equity Interests**: Represented by shares or stock certificates. Shareholders' liability is limited to their investment.

### Key Points:
- **Limited Liability**: Shareholders are only liable to the extent of their shareholding.
- **Corporation vs. Shareholders**: A shareholder can be an employee and receive a salary subject to payroll taxes. Dividends are not subject to payroll or self-employment tax.

### U.S. Tax Laws:
- **C-Corporation**: Taxed as a separate entity. Double taxation occurs—taxed first at the corporate level, then on dividends at the shareholder level.
- **S-Corporation**: Profits and losses pass through to shareholders. Restrictions include a maximum of 100 shareholders, only natural persons, and no nonresident aliens as shareholders.

### Notable Considerations:
- **Double Taxation (C-Corporations)**: Corporate income is taxed first, and dividends are taxed again when distributed to shareholders.
- **Retained Earnings**: Income retained for reinvestment must have valid business reasons, or it may incur additional taxes.
- **S-Corporations**: Pass-through taxation, subject to certain shareholder limits.

### Tax Benefits:
- **Small Business C-Corporations**: May qualify for tax incentives if they meet specific criteria (e.g., receiving less than $1 million in stock value).

Corporations are ideal for ventures with many passive investors or plans for public offerings.

# 6.3.4.3 Maintaining Corporate Status

To maintain corporate status, certain legal formalities must be consistently observed. Failure to do so can result in the courts disregarding the corporation's separate legal status, potentially holding owners and officers personally liable.

### Key Practices:
- **File Organizational Papers**: Ensure correct filing of documents to establish the corporation.
- **Issuing Stocks**: Proper issuance of stock to shareholders.
- **Bylaws**: Instituting and adhering to corporate bylaws.
- **Annual Filings**: Submit required annual reports to the state.
- **Meetings**: Hold annual shareholder and board meetings.
- **Minutes**: Maintain minutes of meetings and significant resolutions.
- **Corporate Records**: Keep up-to-date corporate records.
- **Separate Funds**: Maintain distinct financial records and assets for the corporation.
- **Adequate Capitalization**: Ensure the corporation is adequately capitalized to operate as a business.
- **Avoid Personal Use**: Do not use corporate assets for personal purposes unless properly documented.

### Importance of Minutes:
- **Minutes of Meetings**: Record the actions of the board or shareholders, even if no meeting occurs (unanimous written actions).
- **Review**: Minutes should be reviewed and approved by the board or shareholders at subsequent meetings.
- **Document Compliance**: Ensure that meetings follow bylaws (e.g., quorum, notice, and votes).
  
By maintaining these practices, the corporation’s legal status is protected, and the risk of “piercing the corporate veil” is minimized.

# 6.3.5 Limited Liability Company (LLC)

An LLC is a business entity that combines elements of both corporations and partnerships. It is owned by "members" and can be managed by the members themselves or by appointed "managers," who may or may not be members.

### LLC History:
- The LLC was first introduced in Wyoming in 1977.
- It gained popularity in the 1990s when the IRS ruled that LLCs could be treated as partnerships for tax purposes, even with limited liability for members.
- In 1997, the IRS introduced the "check-the-box" regulations, allowing LLCs to choose their tax treatment as a sole proprietorship, partnership, C-corporation, or S-corporation.

### LLC Characteristics:
- **Creation**: Formed by filing articles of organization with a state agency and entering an operating agreement.
- **Ownership**: Ownership is typically expressed as percentages or units, without certificates representing shares.
- **Limited Liability**: Like a corporation, members' liability is limited to the value of their ownership interest in the LLC.
- **No Formalities**: LLCs are not required to hold annual meetings or file annual reports, though regular meetings can be beneficial.

### Taxation:
- **Tax Flexibility**: LLCs can choose their tax treatment:
  - **Sole Proprietorship** (single-member LLC)
  - **Partnership** (multi-member LLC)
  - **C-Corporation** or **S-Corporation** (if elected)
- If treated as a **sole proprietorship** or **partnership**, members are subject to self-employment tax.
- If treated as a **C-corporation** or **S-corporation**, members can be employees and receive salaries subject to payroll taxes, but distributions are not subject to self-employment tax.

### Advantages & Disadvantages:
- LLCs offer significant flexibility and liability protection, but some states (like California) charge higher fees for LLCs.

# 6.3.6 Limited Liability Entities—A Comparison

Choosing the appropriate legal form for a business is a complex decision, with various factors influencing the choice. The decision is not permanent, as entities can often change their legal form when business circumstances evolve.

### 6.3.6.1 Expense
- **Sole Proprietorships & General Partnerships**: Easier and cheaper to set up, but involve unlimited liability, making them unsuitable for riskier ventures like technology businesses. A Limited Liability Entity (LLC) might offer better protection in many cases.

### 6.3.6.2 Shareholder Options
- **C-Corporations**: Ideal for businesses planning to have many passive shareholders or a public stock offering. They can issue shares to attract capital and offer stock options to employees.
- **S-Corporations**: Can only issue common stock and are limited in the number and type of shareholders. C-Corporations are preferred for public offerings.

### 6.3.6.3 Taxation
- **C-Corporations**: Subject to corporate tax on income. Owners are not taxed on retained earnings, but may face double taxation on dividends. In some cases, C-Corporations may offer a lower combined tax bill compared to pass-through entities.
- **LLCs and S-Corporations**: Offer pass-through taxation, allowing profits and losses to be passed to owners. An S-Corporation provides a unique advantage in managing self-employment taxes by taxing salary only, not dividends, as long as compensation is reasonable.

### 6.3.6.4 Distribution of Profits and Losses
- **LLCs**: Can allocate profits and losses disproportionately to ownership percentages through the operating agreement. Limited liability remains regardless of management control.
- **S-Corporations & LPs**: Profits and losses in an S-Corporation must align with ownership percentages. LPs have management control limitations to maintain limited liability.
- **Flexibility of LLC**: The LLC can distribute profits or losses in ways that benefit members, such as allocating more losses to attract investors for tax benefits. Additionally, LLCs are not subject to restrictions on shareholder numbers and types like S-Corporations.

### 6.3.6.5 Formalities

The formation of LPs, corporations, and LLCs all requires comparable effort and cost. Below is a comparison of the organic documents required for the formation of different limited liability entities.

#### Exhibit 6.7: Comparison of Organic Documents for Different Types of Limited Liability Entities

| **Entity Type**          | **Limited Partnership (LP)**                | **Corporation**                          | **LLC**                                  |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Filing Required**       | Required but not filed                     | Required but not filed                   | Not required but desirable               |
| **Certificate/Document**  | Certificate of Limited Partnership         | Articles of Incorporation/Charter        | Articles of Organization                 |
| **Operating/Other Docs**  | Limited Partnership Agreement              | Bylaws                                   | Operating Agreement                      |
| **Shareholder Agreement** | Not Required                               | Shareholders Agreement                   | Not Required                             |

### Key Points:
- **LLCs**: Do not have the same formal requirements for meetings, minutes, and other procedures as corporations. 
- **LPs**: Similarly, LPs do not need to observe the same formalities. However, they require a general partner, which is often a separate limited liability entity.
- **LLCs vs. LPs**: The LLC structure provides the same limited liability benefits as an LP, but without the complexity of needing a separate general partner.



## 6.4 EQUITY AND EQUITY TYPES

Equity is simply another term for an ownership interest in a business. The particular terminology used to denominate equity varies depending upon the legal structure of the entity. As noted earlier, equity interests in partnerships and LLCs are typically referred to in terms of ownership percentages or units corresponding to a percentage of ownership. Equity in a corporation is referred to as "stock" for shares (Exhibit 6.8).

#### Exhibit 6.8: Terminology for Ownership Interests

| **Entity Type**    | **Partnership**            | **Corporation**        | **LLC**                |
|--------------------|----------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| **Equity Term**    | Units or percentage        | Stock or shares        | Units or percentage    |

### 6.4.1 Corporate Stocks

1. **Authorized Shares**: A corporation's articles of incorporation specify a maximum number of shares it can issue, which can be changed with shareholder approval.  
   - **Example**: A startup can authorize 1 million shares, but only issue 500,000 initially.

2. **Issued Shares**: Shares given to founders and investors represent the ownership structure, with each shareholder owning a proportion based on shares held.  
   - **Example**: If an investor holds 100,000 shares of 500,000 issued, they own 20% of the company.

3. **Unissued Shares**: Reserved shares that are not yet distributed but can be used for future fundraising or other purposes.  
   - **Example**: A company reserves 200,000 shares for future rounds of investment.

4. **Share Classes**: Different types of shares (e.g., Class A, Class B) may be issued, with varying rights on voting, dividends, and asset distribution.  
   - **Example**: Class A shares might have voting rights, while Class B shares only receive dividends.

5. **Transferability**: Shareholders may face restrictions on transferring shares, often governed by buy-sell clauses in the shareholders' agreement.  
   - **Example**: A founder’s shares may only be sold to other shareholders or approved buyers.

### Common Stock vs. Preferred Stock

1. **Common Stock**: Represents basic ownership, with voting rights and potential for dividends, but no guaranteed payment. Common stockholders are last in line during liquidation.  
   - **Example**: A shareholder with common stock may vote on company matters and receive dividends if the company is profitable, but they are paid after creditors and preferred stockholders in case of liquidation.

2. **Preferred Stock**: Provides a fixed dividend, ranks higher than common stock in distributions, and often has limited or no voting rights.  
   - **Example**: An investor holding preferred stock receives dividends before common stockholders and has priority in liquidation, but typically doesn’t have voting rights.

3. **Risk and Return**: Common stock has higher potential for growth but carries more risk, while preferred stock offers more stability but less growth potential.  
   - **Example**: Common stockholders benefit more if the company grows, but they also lose more if the company fails, whereas preferred stockholders receive steady dividends with less risk but limited upside.
     
### 6.4.3.1 Preferred Stock Distributions

1. **Cumulative Preferred Stock**: Accrued dividends must be paid before dividends to other stock classes; if a dividend is missed, it accumulates and must be paid when resumed.  
   - **Example**: If a company misses a quarterly dividend, it must pay the owed dividends to cumulative preferred stockholders first when it resumes payments.

2. **Noncumulative Preferred Stock**: Dividends do not accumulate; missed payments are not owed in the future.  
   - **Example**: If no dividend is paid in one period, noncumulative preferred stockholders will not receive it in the future.

### 6.4.3.2 Convertibility

Preferred stock may be **convertible** into cash, debt, common stock, or other property, either at the option of the corporation, shareholder, or upon a designated event.  
   - **Example**: A shareholder might convert preferred stock into common stock during a funding round for more potential growth.

### 6.4.3.3 Participating Preferred Stock

Participating preferred stockholders receive both a fixed dividend and a share of surplus profits after common stock dividends are paid. They may also participate in liquidation distribution on an "as converted" basis with common stockholders.  
   - **Example**: After receiving fixed dividends, participating preferred stockholders also share in the company’s profits or liquidation proceeds.

### 6.4.3.4 Voting Rights

Preferred stock may have special or no voting rights, while common stock typically provides one vote per share.  
   - **Example**: Common stockholders vote on board elections, but preferred stockholders may have limited or no voting rights.

### 6.4.3.5 Founder's Stock

Founder's stock is issued to company founders and may have unique features like conversion rights, liquidation preferences, and vesting requirements.  
   - **Example**: A founder may receive stock with special voting rights or conditions that ensure they retain control over the company.

### 6.5 Raising Capital
1. **Co-Venturing Paradigm**: A venture is a separate entity, and investors (co-venturers) contribute resources like money, assets, or services in exchange for consideration such as equity, profit interest, or money (e.g., interest on a loan).  
   - **Example**: A co-venturer invests money and receives equity in return.

2. **Debt vs. Equity Financing**:  
   - **Debt Financing**: Borrowing money or selling bonds with a promise to repay with interest.  
   - **Equity Financing**: Selling ownership (equity) in the venture in exchange for investment.  
   - **Example**: A company borrows $100,000 (debt) or sells 10% ownership (equity) to raise funds.

### 6.6 Equity Distribution in the Start-up Venture

1. **Monetary & Nonmonetary Contributions**: Ownership percentages are based on the value of contributions—monetary or nonmonetary (e.g., intellectual property, services).  
   - **Example**: An investor contributes $50,000 for 20% equity, while a founder contributes technology and receives 30%.

2. **Negotiation & Valuation**: Nonmonetary contributions, such as intellectual property, are often valued based on relevance, merit, and legal protections, with negotiation playing a key role.  
   - **Example**: A founder with a patent may negotiate for a larger equity share due to its potential value to the venture.

### 6.6.1 Employee Stock Options (ESO)

1. **ESO Plans**: Companies offer employees stock options to motivate, reward, and retain talent, giving them the right to buy company stock at a fixed price (strike price) within a specific time.  
   - **Example**: An employee can buy stock at $10/share when the market price is $20/share, profiting from the difference.

### 6.6.2 Vesting

1. **Vesting Schedule**: Employees must meet conditions (e.g., length of service) before they can exercise stock options. Common schedules allow 25% of options to vest after 12 months, with the rest vesting over time.  
   - **Example**: An employee can exercise 25% of their options after one year of service.

### 6.6.3 Restrictive Clauses

1. **Restrictions on Stock Transfer**: ESOs often include clauses that restrict stock transferability, such as a period where stocks cannot be sold or right-of-first-refusal clauses.  
   - **Example**: A former employee may be required to sell their stock back to the company upon leaving.

### 6.6.4 Tax Issues
1. **ISOs vs. NSOs**:  
   - **ISOs**: Qualified for special tax treatment, no taxes upon grant or exercise; taxed at long-term capital gains rates when sold.  
   - **NSOs**: Taxed as ordinary income when exercised; any difference between market value and strike price is taxed.  
   - **Example**: An employee with ISOs pays no taxes when the options are exercised, but pays capital gains tax when selling the stock.



## Chapter 7: Developing and Implementing the Technology Business Plan

### TaskRabbit's Success Due to Effective Planning

Leah Busque, the founder of TaskRabbit, created a disruptive technology platform that connects people with others to perform tasks, like walking dogs or assembling furniture. The company initially struggled but gained traction after attending a startup boot camp and refining its business plan. With guidance from influential advisors and venture capitalists, TaskRabbit grew into a successful business, now expanding to small businesses as customers. It faces competition from startups like Fancy Hands and larger companies like Lyft. The future of TaskRabbit depends on how it adapts in a competitive market.

### 7.1 Introduction

A business plan is crucial for any new venture, especially in today’s complex, competitive, and fast-changing technological landscape. It serves as a roadmap for entrepreneurs, guiding them from conception to growth. A well-developed business plan is essential for success in the modern business environment, helping entrepreneurs manage the complexities of establishing and growing their ventures.

### 7.2 Writing the Business Plan

A successful technology venture requires effective planning, and writing a business plan helps solidify and refine ideas. The main body of the plan should be around 30–40 pages, excluding exhibits or appendices. While the length can vary, the plan needs to be clear, concise, and well-presented, with attention to details like spelling, grammar, and layout. 

A key component is the two-page executive summary, which is often the first document potential investors will see. Entrepreneurs should seek assistance with editing and presentation to ensure the plan is professional and compelling.

### Mini-Case: Startup Valley Provides Crowdfunding Platform

StartupValley is a crowdfunding platform for technology startups, similar to Kickstarter, but focused specifically on tech ventures. Entrepreneurs can present their business plans to attract investors. Once SEC regulations are finalized, the platform will allow both accredited and unaccredited investors to fund tech startups. Successful ventures are charged a 5% fee on funds raised.


### 7.3 Elements of a Business Plan

A technology business plan typically contains three main sections:

1. **Section 1**: **Title Page, Table of Contents, Executive Summary**
   - **Title Page**: Includes the company name, contact info, management team details, purpose of the plan, and funding requirements.
   - **Table of Contents**: Lists subsections, page numbers, and all figures, tables, and exhibits.
   - **Executive Summary**: This is the most important part of the business plan, as many investors only read this section. It should clearly define:
     - **Problem**: Describes the nature and size of the problem to be solved (e.g., TaskRabbit addresses the need for personal tasks).
     - **Solution**: Describes the product/service and its uniqueness (e.g., background-checked individuals to perform tasks).
     - **Market**: Details the size of the market, trends, and growth rate over the next 3-5 years.
     - **Team**: Provides an overview of the top management and their qualifications (e.g., TaskRabbit’s CEO Leah Busque and advisors Tim Ferriss and Peter Thiel).
     - **Financial Projections**: Summarizes expected revenues, gross margin, operating expenses, and profits/losses over the first five years.
     - **Resources Needed**: Details the capital required and any contact information for follow-up.

2. **Section 2**: **Detailed Business Description and Plans**
   - **Business Description**: Overview of the venture, products, mission, and business model.
   - **Industry Description**: Includes the type of industry, market trends, competitors, and forecasts.
   - **Marketing Plan**: Outlines market segments, pricing, distribution, promotion, and expected sales.
   - **Technology Plan**: Describes the technology being used, its competitive advantage, and comparison with existing technologies.
   - **Financial Plan**: Includes pro forma financial statements, such as income statements, cash flow, and balance sheets.

3. **Section 3**: **Appendices**
   - This section contains detailed supporting documents such as résumés of principals, market research, contracts, supplier lists, and other relevant materials.

### Key Points:
- **Executive Summary**: The executive summary is crucial and often determines whether an investor will continue reading the full business plan.
- **Well-Organized Plan**: A business plan must be clear, concise, and structured to highlight the critical aspects of the venture and attract investors.

### 7.3.2 Section 2: Business Description, Industry, Technology, and Marketing Plans

**Section 2** starts after the executive summary and covers the detailed components of the business venture:

#### 7.3.2.1 **Description of the Business**
This section describes the nature of the venture and how it operates, highlighting:
- **Products/Services**: A detailed explanation of the products or services offered, focusing on how they solve the identified problem. If the product involves new technology, it will be elaborated further in the technology section.
- **Mission Statement**: A concise description of the company’s core purpose and values.
- **Business Model**: The overall approach the company takes to conduct business. If it differs significantly from existing industry practices, this difference should be emphasized.

#### 7.3.2.2 **Description of the Industry**
This section provides a thorough analysis of the industry in which the venture operates:
- **Industry Type and Size**: Describes the type, size, and scope of the industry.
- **Trends and Growth**: Discusses trends over the past 3-5 years, future outlook, and growth rate.
- **Competitor Analysis**: Identifies competitors and evaluates how they are addressing the same problem the new venture solves.
- **Use of Data**: The section often includes charts, graphs, and other data visualizations to explain the market dynamics and competitive landscape.

#### 7.3.2.3 **The Technology Plan**
If the venture involves a technological innovation:
- **State of Technology**: Describes the current technological landscape and how the new technology changes or improves upon existing practices.
- **Patent Details**: If applicable, the technology plan should discuss any patents filed or pending and include patent documents as an appendix.

#### 7.3.2.4 **The Marketing Plan**
This section outlines the strategies to market and sell the product or service:
- **Market Segmentation**: Defines the target market using segmentation techniques (e.g., demographic, geographic) and outlines the size of the market.
- **Target Market**: Identifies the specific customer profile for the product or service.
- **Marketing Mix**: Discusses the 4 P's of marketing:
  - **Product/Service**: Characteristics, quality, assortment, packaging, and servicing.
  - **Price**: Pricing strategy considering consumer reactions, costs, and competitor prices.
  - **Distribution**: Distribution channels (e.g., retailers, wholesalers) and logistics (e.g., transportation, warehousing).
  - **Promotion**: Advertising, personal selling, publicity, social media, and sales promotion.
- **Marketing Budget**: A budget for the first year, detailing how marketing funds will be allocated to achieve sales targets.

### Key Points:
- **Business Description**: Should clearly articulate how the business will operate and deliver its products/services.
- **Industry Description**: Requires significant data to show understanding of market trends and competition.
- **Technology Plan**: Essential for tech ventures to describe how new technology gives the venture a competitive advantage.
- **Marketing Plan**: Should detail target market, the marketing strategy, and the resources needed to execute it effectively, including a clear budget for the first year.

### 7.3.2.5 The Financial Plan
The financial plan provides a detailed forecast of the business's financial health and operations. It includes 12 key financial statements, most of which are **pro forma** (forecasted) and later become actual statements. The **sources and uses of funds statement** is the first document, detailing:
- **Uses of funds**: Describes the capital needed for various costs (e.g., renovations, inventory, working capital, reserves).
- **Sources of funds**: Identifies where the capital will come from, such as the entrepreneur, friends, family, banks, private investors, venture capital, and grants.
- **Pro Forma Financial Statements**:
  - Income statement (5-year summary, by month for Year 1, by quarter for Years 2 and 3).
  - Cash flow statement (5-year summary, by month for Year 1, by quarter for Years 2 and 3).
  - Balance sheet (for Years 1, 2, and 3).
  
This section provides a clear financial outlook and helps the business plan to raise capital and secure investors.

#### 7.3.2.6 The Production Plan
The production plan outlines how the product or service will be developed and delivered:
- **Service Ventures**: Some service-based businesses may not need a production plan.
- **Cost Breakdown**: Lists all individual costs involved in producing the offering, emphasizing potential cost reductions through economies of scale.
- **Suppliers/Outsourcing**: Describes suppliers and outsourcing firms involved in production, highlighting the details of their roles and relationships.

#### 7.3.2.7 The Organizational Plan
The organizational plan focuses on the structure and legal framework of the venture:
- **Ownership Structure**: Defines the legal form of ownership (e.g., proprietorship, partnership, LLC, C-corporation). The choice should consider factors like taxation, liability, and the number of investors or employees.
  - In the U.S., LLCs or S-Corporations are common due to favorable tax laws and limited liability.
  - Specific countries may have unique requirements, like the need for a foreign partner.
- **Lines of Authority**: Explains the structure of the organization, typically shown in an organizational chart. It defines key roles and responsibilities, though specific individuals may not be assigned until the business is operational.
  - **Key Positions**: The founder(s) should assume roles aligned with their expertise, such as CEO/president, especially in the initial phases.

### Key Points:
- **Financial Plan**: Includes detailed forecasts (pro forma statements) for income, cash flow, and balance sheets, with a focus on funding sources and uses.
- **Production Plan**: Describes how the product or service will be produced, including associated costs and outsourcing strategies.
- **Organizational Plan**: Covers the business’s legal ownership structure, taxation, liability, and organizational hierarchy, typically visualized through an organizational chart.

### 7.3.2.8 The Operational Plan
The operational plan details how the company will operate on a day-to-day basis:
- **Operations Flow**: This section describes the flow of goods, services, and orders within the company.
- **Exit Strategy**: It includes a strategy for investors to realize returns on their investments, typically within 5–7 years. There are three exit strategies:
  1. **Generating retained earnings**: Profits reinvested in the company.
  2. **Selling to another company**: Most common exit strategy, requiring identification of potential buyers (3-4 companies).
  3. **Going public**: The company can go public and be listed on the stock exchange.
  
The section concludes with a summary that recaps the operational plan.

### 7.3.3 Section 3: Backup Material
Section 3 includes all the backup data supporting the business plan:
- **Support Data**: Secondary data, research findings, contracts, leases, and any patents.
- **Resumes**: Resumes of the entrepreneur and key management team members.
- **Purpose**: No new information is introduced here; it serves as an appendix to substantiate Section 2.

#### 7.3.3.1 Estimating (Forecasting) Revenues and Expenses
Estimating revenues and expenses is challenging, especially for technology entrepreneurs with new or disruptive products. Forecasting is often based on:
- **Industry experience**: Entrepreneurs' previous industry experience and their network.
- **Optimism factor**: New ventures may not reach established sales levels in their early years.
  
#### 7.3.3.2 Estimating Sales (Revenue)
- **Sales Forecast**: The first step is estimating sales in units, not dollars. Sales are calculated by multiplying unit sales by the unit price.
- **Market Comparison**: Use data from similar products or services, including sales figures from government publications and trade journals.
- **Growth Estimation**: For future years (2-5), sales forecasts are adjusted based on the projected growth rate of the industry.

  - **B2C (Business-to-Consumer)**: Sales for consumer products are harder to estimate due to market variability. Tools like scenario and sensitivity analysis help make predictions.
  - **B2B (Business-to-Business)**: Sales estimates are easier for industrial products because of a more stable, less geographically dispersed market.

#### 7.3.3.3 Estimating Expenses
- **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**: The most difficult expense to estimate, especially for breakthrough innovations. Trusted engineers or manufacturers can provide accurate cost estimates, considering economies of scale.
  - For services, COGS can be calculated based on time-equivalent expenses involved in service delivery.
- **Operating Expenses**: These are easier to estimate and typically include:
  - Salaries and fringe benefits for management and employees.
  - Operational costs like packaging, distribution, office supplies, utilities, and insurance.
  
  These expenses should be clearly documented for effective management.

### Key Points:
- **Operational Plan**: Details daily operations and includes an exit strategy for investors (e.g., selling to another company or going public).
- **Backup Material**: Section 3 provides supporting data and documents, like contracts and resumes, that substantiate the business plan.
- **Revenue and Expense Forecasting**:
  - Estimating **sales** involves calculating unit sales and adjusting for industry growth.
  - **Expenses** are estimated by calculating the cost of goods sold and operating costs.
  
This section provides crucial information about the operational and financial forecast for the business, helping investors understand how the venture will function, grow, and generate returns.


# 7.3.4 Business Plan Development and Update

The business plan serves as both a **guide for the venture's direction** and a **tool for raising financial resources**.

### Writing the Business Plan:
1. **Drafting**: Begin by outlining the information.
2. **Rewriting**: Revise for clarity and consistency.
3. **Audience Focus**: Ensure logical flow and clarity.
4. **Feedback**: Have others critique it, or hire a professional editor.

### Living Document:
- The business plan is **not static**; it should be **updated periodically**.
- **Review regularly**, especially in the first year, and annually thereafter to align with real business conditions.

This process ensures that the business plan remains a relevant guide for growth and decision-making.


# Chapter 8: Capital and Capital Sources

## Investor Capital Flow to Hydro-Power:
Small investors are increasingly attracted to **hydro-electric power generation**, particularly from rivers and streams. Investors like Sam Perry have refurbished old plants to sell power to local grids, generating significant cash flow. These investments are supported by a growing demand for **green energy** and environmental sustainability.

## 8.1 Introduction:
- **Technology Ventures** require varying amounts of capital, with some needing large sums (e.g., Tesla Motors) and others needing minimal investment (e.g., Dropbox, Airbnb).
- **Capital Sources for Entrepreneurs**: Technology entrepreneurs have multiple options for obtaining capital, which change as their ventures grow.
- The chapter explores:
  1. **Managing capital needs over time**.
  2. Developing a **capital management plan**.
  3. **Fundraising tools and techniques**.
  4. **Alternatives to debt or equity** capital.

# 8.2 The Capital Management Plan

The **capital management plan** helps entrepreneurs manage external funding while minimizing the impact on ownership and control. It involves four key considerations:

1. **Self-funding vs. External Funding**: Self-funding avoids external costs but may not always be feasible. External capital can share risks, leverage funds, or offer advantageous valuations.
2. **Type of Capital**: Capital is generally categorized into **equity** (ownership stake) or **debt** (loan repayment with interest). 
   - **Equity Financing**: Offers flexibility, shares risk, and has no short-term repayment obligations, but results in dilution of ownership.
   - **Debt Financing**: Involves fixed repayment, less costly than equity in successful ventures, but creates short-term pressure and risk.
3. **When to Seek Capital**: The timing of fundraising should align with specific **milestones** that increase the venture's value.
4. **How Much Capital to Seek**: The amount should be sufficient to meet immediate goals and avoid overcapitalization, which can lead to excessive dilution or unnecessary debt. Raising too much capital can also hinder cost control and operational efficiency.

A well-structured **fundraising deal** outlines the terms between entrepreneurs, investors, or lenders. Entrepreneurs should maintain an updated **business plan** and understand the specific requirements for **debt** or **equity financing**. Additionally, government programs like the **SBIR** grant can provide alternative funding sources.


# 8.3 REGULATION OF FINANCING ACTIVITIES

Because of past abuses, many jurisdictions stringently regulate the sale of passive investment instruments–such as stocks and bonds. In general, the regulations are imposed through what are referred to as Securities Laws. In the United States, there is regulation both at the federal level (through the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)), and at the state level through various analogous agencies. The federal securities laws govern all sales of securities. The term security is very broadly defined, covering, in essence, any situation that involves using someone else’s money based on the “promise of profits,” prospects of a “return” from other than the investors own efforts, or makes money subject to the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others. In other words, it covers not only stocks and bonds, but also other forms of investment in a venture, where the investor is not actively involved in the management of the venture.

## KEY POINT
**Not All Equity Interests Are Securities**  
One of the reasons for the popularity of the Limited Liability Company (LLC) form of entity for startups is that it provides limited liability, while at the same time, without necessarily implicating the securities laws. Equity interests in an LLC are typically not securities, so long as all members are actively involved in the management of the venture. General Partnership interests are likewise outside of the definition of security, but do not provide limited liability. Corporate stock, however, even if sold to management, are expressly defined as Securities under U.S. Federal law.

Any time fundraising activities involve the sale of a security, certain rules relating to the disclosure of information must be observed. You are required to make “full disclosure” to the potential investor of all “material facts.” Information is a “material fact” if it is something that investors would typically want to consider before making the decision to purchase the security.

And, unless the activities fall within very specific exemptions, not only must disclosure be complete and accurate, but the security (or transaction involving the security) must be registered with the SEC (and sometimes also with analogous state agencies) and written information must be provided to prospective investors in a specific format (a prospectus in a prescribed form) that has been “deemed effective” by the SEC. Transactions that fall within the specific exemptions are referred to as “private placements,” and those that do not are referred to as “public offerings.” The first time that a venture makes a public offering is referred to as an “Initial Public Offering” (IPO). The registration process is sometimes referred to as “going public.”

The registration process tends to be very expensive, and once “public” a venture is required to maintain certain internal audit controls, and publicly disclose certain information relating to business operations, financial conditions and management. The administrative burden on Public companies imposed by the securities laws and the costs of compliance is significant. The IPO has historically been a favored exit strategy (liquidity event) for certain types of investors. In view of the cost under present-day regulation, the IPO has become much less popular. In any event, “going public” is generally not a viable option for startups; if for no other reason, at least two years of audited financials are required for registration.

It is desirable (if not imperative), as a general proposition, that efforts to raise capital for startup technology ventures fall under one of the exemptions to the registration requirements in all applicable jurisdictions (e.g., in the US both at federal and state levels). Exemptions under the federal law are defined by regulations promulgated by the SEC. In general, the respective exemptions have different criteria, and apply under different circumstances. In general, in order to qualify for the various exemptions the venture and offering must meet (depending upon the particular exemption):

- Limitations on the dollar amount of the offering (or other offerings within a predetermined time period);
- Limitations on the number and nature of the entities to which the security can be offered;
- Restrictions on the types of entities offering the securities (issuers) to which the exemption is available;
- Restrictions on general solicitation or advertising;
- Requirements as to the nature of the disclosure that must be made and/or documents provided to the offerees;
- Requirements as to the nature of filing with the SEC; and
- Requirements for restrictions on stock transfer.

Some federal exemptions provide relief from (preempt) state registration requirements, others expressly require that state exemption criteria be met.

The securities laws draw distinctions based upon the wealth and sophistication of the entities to which the security can be offered. **Accredited investors** are defined as (in addition to various institutions such as banks, investment companies, retirement plans, and the like) individuals whose net worth at the time that the securities were purchased (individually or jointly with spouse) exceeds $1 million (exclusive of primary residence), or whose individual net income was over $200,000 (or $300,000 jointly with spouse) for each of the two years prior to the purchase, and reasonably expects the same income level in the current year. A “sophisticated investor” is someone who has, or is represented by someone (a "purchaser representative") who has, (or you reasonably believe to have) “such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters that he is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the prospective investment.”

A small offering (no more than $5 million) is exempted from Federal registration requirements if it is private (no advertisements or general solicitations) and made strictly to accredited investors. Various other exemptions have limitations on participation of non-accredited investors, and specific disclosure requirements in respect of non-accredited investors.

There is also a general “private placement” exemption for private offerings, although the precise requirements to qualify for the exemption are not specified in the statute. Private placement “safe harbors” are, however, specifically defined by what is known as Reg D, “Rules Governing the Limited Offer and Sale of Securities without Registration under the Securities Act of 1933.” Reg D actually defines a number of different exemptions, with different criteria/limitations according to, e.g., maximum size of the offering permitted; participation of non-accredited investors; general solicitation/advertising; and/or applicability of state regulations to the offering.

Other exemptions are provided based on (along with specified criteria and limitations): filing what is effectively a mini-registration (Reg A exemption); strictly intra-state offerings; and offerings strictly outside of the US.

In 2013, the SEC proposed to revise its rules according to the Jumpstart Our Business Startups or JOBS Act that was passed in 2012. This Act was intended to encourage private investment in small startups, and to open the door to funding that otherwise might be closed for many startup ventures. Some of the principle proposed changes that are consequences of this Act include:

- Increasing the number of shareholders a company may have before being required to register with the SEC;
- Exemption for small companies from the rules prohibiting public offering of equity shares. This provision would enable small companies to publicize a stock offering, including making use of publicly available online crowdfunding portals that link small offerings with people. Portals that offer non-equity “investing” at the time this book is going to press include Kickstarter, CrowdCube, Seedrs, CrowdCheck, CircleUp and others.
- Relief from some regulatory requirements for companies designated as emerging growth companies. This provision primarily exempts such companies from some of the disclosure requirements that were enacted following corporate scandals of the early 2000’s.
- Allowing larger fundraising under the SEC’s Regulation A of up to $50 million (increased from its previous limit of $5 million).

The JOBS Act went into effect in late 2013 and will most certainly provide more opportunities for growing technology ventures to generate visibility for their fundraising efforts if some of the key provisions that it intends are passed by the U.S. Congress. It will be interesting to see how crowdfunding and the ability to publicly solicit investment opportunities will affect fundraisers and investors. The Mini-Case below provides an example of a technology entrepreneur who was able to launch his venture based on a successful Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign:

### MINI-CASE  
**Pebble E-Paper Smartwatch Raises $10M on Kickstarter**  
One of Kickstarter’s most successful fundraising campaigns was engineered by the founders of the Pebble smartwatch. The Pebble watch is designed to connect to Android or iOS smartphones via Bluetooth technology. For example, the watch can alert users about incoming calls via a silent vibration. The Pebble smartwatch also can download apps of its own turning it into, for example, a bike computer that displays speed, distance, and pace. The use of an “e-paper” display permits you to read the Pebble watch output even in direct sunlight. Users can customize their Pebble smartwatch with colored wristbands and apps unique to their lifestyles. Currently available apps are as diverse as a range finder for golf enthusiasts to apps that let users customize the watch face to their individual taste.

Initially intending to raise just $100,000, Pebble’s Kickstarter campaign garnered nearly 70,000 contributors who contributed over $10M! Pebble offered a variety of non-equity items in return for contributions of various amounts, e.g., a subscription to an exclusive newsletter "on all things pebble" for contributions of $1 or more; various models of the pebble watch for contributions running up from $99 – $220 or more; or early delivery of a prototype smartwatch, plus later delivery of a production model for contributions of $235 or more.

Even if exempted from registration, the full disclosure requirements are applicable to all securities offerings. The full disclosure to investors required by the securities laws for other than public offerings is typically provided through a document referred to as a **Private Placement Memorandum (PPM)**.

The PPM resembles a business plan in that it will describe the business, including its products and services, management team, financial projections, competitors, and the target market. In addition, the PPM goes far beyond the business plan in providing the investor with disclosure of the risks associated with an investment in the venture. Risks discussed in the PPM might include the potential for patent filings to be rejected by the patent office, misjudgment of the market potential of the venture’s products and services, inability to raise sufficient capital in the future to operate, and many other contingencies. In general, technology entrepreneurs should involve legal counsel in preparing any PPM.



## 8.3.1 Costs of Equity Financing

The costs associated with conducting a traditional private equity offering (e.g., an offering not using the new crowdfunding approach) are usually greater than applying for and receiving an equivalent amount of debt. The greater costs involved in a traditional equity offering are part of the technology entrepreneur’s deliberations when deciding on the type of financing to pursue. Of even greater influence on this decision is the degree to which equity financing will dilute the ownership positions of the existing shareholders. Anytime a venture sells shares to raise capital, the ownership positions of the existing shareholders will be affected. The degree to which dilution occurs is a function of the venture’s valuation at the time of the financing.

A discussion of methods for determining a venture’s valuation will follow later. However, here we will simply note the effects of different valuation levels on venture ownership. Suppose two individuals launch a technology venture, and they decide to split ownership equally between them, with each now owning 50 percent of the company. They have invested their own funds to launch the venture, and so they have no other shareholders. Now, suppose they have developed their technology past the prototype stage and have received positive feedback from test markets. These two entrepreneurs are ready to expand the company, but they need capital to pursue that end. They decide that they will need to raise $1 million. What effect will that amount of capital raised have on their respective ownership positions?

The answer is: “It depends.” It depends on their ability to persuade investors regarding the value of the venture. Let’s assume the two entrepreneurs convince each other that their company—today, before they’ve raised any money—is worth $2 million. In the language of deal making, this is referred to as the pre-money valuation of the venture. That is to say, the pre-money valuation is what the venture, arguably, is worth prior to any new money coming in. There are a number of factors to consider in establishing the value of a private company, but we will put off that discussion until later. For now, let’s assume that the $2 million pre-money valuation is reasonable, and that the two owners are able to persuade potential investors that this is a reasonable valuation of the company. At that valuation, each owner’s 50 percent stake in the company is worth $1 million (50 percent of $2 million).

If the technology entrepreneurs are successful in raising the $1 million, the venture would have a post-money valuation of $3 million. Note the post-money valuation is simply the pre-money valuation plus the amount raised. What is the dilutive effect of this raise to the two original shareholders? It’s plain to see that the investors (regardless of how many) who put in the $1 million will own 1/3 of a venture that has a post-money valuation of $3 million. The two entrepreneurs, who previously owned 50 percent each, have been diluted by 1/6 apiece to a stake of 33.3 percent, respectively. Together, they maintain a controlling interest, 67 percent, in the company, but they have been diluted. Note, however, that despite the dilution in the percentage of their ownership, the dollar value of their shares remains $1 million (i.e., 1/3 of $3 million).

## 8.3.2 Sources of Equity Financing

The technology entrepreneur can pick from a wide range of sources for equity financing that will vary depending on the venture’s stage of development. All ventures can be described by virtue of their development stage, which in itself conveys useful information to lenders and investors, enabling them to sort through the deals they encounter. A common breakdown of the various stages of development is presented in Exhibit 8.1.

In the seed stage, most ventures are funded by the founders, and anyone else they can convince of the potential for their success. For most technology ventures in seed stage, this broader group of potential investors is limited to what is often referred to as “FF&F”—which stands for “friends, family, and fools.” This little memory device is only partly facetious. Scholarly research has demonstrated that most pre-startup technology ventures are funded by the entrepreneur, family members, friends, and business partners. The other “F”—fools—is used primarily as a reminder that startup ventures are very risky investments.

Seed stage ventures, especially those that have not yet begun generating revenue from sales, are at a very high risk of failure. Because of this, investors and lenders have little incentive to put their capital to work at this stage. Research into the sources of funds for seed stage ventures is very clear. In most cases, funds are derived from the assets of the founders. The good news is that most entrepreneurial ventures are launched with less than $20,000 in seed funds. The founders may tap into their personal savings, leverage a line of credit on a credit card, take out a home equity loan, and adopt other strategies to accumulate the needed startup funds.

## 8.3.3 Angel Financing

As technology ventures launch and enter what is referred to as the early stage, most continue to be funded by founders and their network of family and friends. However, if the venture has matured beyond the prototyping stage and is preparing to, or actually beginning to, sell into the target market, then angel financing may be available.

Angel investors are high net worth individuals who are interested in allocating a portion of their overall portfolio to high-risk and, potentially, high-return private ventures. Angel investing has become a significant source of capital for seed and early stage technology ventures in the United States. Angel investors provided nearly $23 billion in financing in 2012. They often act alone, investing both their own and their family’s wealth. However, many angels aggregate in groups to review and discuss deals, and to co-invest with others in order to have a larger impact on the ventures they prefer.

According to the Angel Capital Association, there are more than 350 angel investor groups throughout the United States and Canada. In the United States, most angel groups are concentrated on the East and West coasts. However, each state has at least several angel investing groups, primarily concentrated in the larger cities. For example, there are three angel investor groups in the state of Arizona, one of which is based in Phoenix and focuses exclusively on technology ventures. The Arizona Technology Investor Forum (ATIF) is an angel investor group that meets several times per year and reviews three or four ventures at each meeting. Meeting formats are fairly standard across angel groups. Entrepreneurs generally are allotted time for a brief (20–30 minute) presentation, which is usually followed by 15–20 minutes of question and answer. Some groups also perform extensive due diligence on the ventures that present. For groups that provide due diligence for members, the findings of the individual or team that performed the due diligence are also reported at the meeting.

Few angel groups specialize in any single industry, and most have interests and expertise among their members in a variety of areas. Angel groups mainly invest in the range of $150,000 to $500,000 per deal. However, some groups can go higher than that. In 2012, there were more than 250,000 active angel investors in the United States, but only 15,000 of them were members of angel groups. Thus, most angel investors are independent of angel groups. Determined technology entrepreneurs need to find these non-affiliated angels to provide the highest probability of acquiring necessary funding. Of course, given our definition of angels as high-net worth individuals (more than $1M in net worth), there are some obvious places they might be found: golf clubs, charity events, and entrepreneurship networking events are three locations that seem likely. Another good technique for finding these unaffiliated angels is to talk to other entrepreneurs. They may have some leads to angel investors and may be able to assist with an introduction.


## 8.3.4 Venture Capital

For the technology venture that receives angel capital, the challenge becomes growing the venture. Ideally, the technology entrepreneur wants to grow the venture, increasing the enterprise value, which would result in a return on investment for the angel investors. If the growth is substantial and future growth projections even greater, then the technology venture may become attractive to venture capital.

Venture capital is managed by venture capital (VC) firms. VC firms are typically structured around a team of general partners who often are successful entrepreneurs, or, at least, financially experienced individuals. VC firms raise money from high net worth individuals and financial institutions (such as insurance companies, pension funds, and the like) who are considered to be limited partners to the VC firm. These individuals pledge an amount of capital to the VC firm, and are required to put as much as 20 percent of it immediately into a fund that will be managed by the general partners. This capital is then invested in ventures according to the interests and expertise of the firm. As the fund is invested over time, the limited partners will be called upon to invest additional portions of their pledged amount. The typical VC firm structure is illustrated in Exhibit 8.2.

Most venture capital firms have specific industries and venture types that they prefer. For example, one of the top venture capital firms in Silicon Valley, Benchmark Capital, invests primarily in high-growth Internet companies. The firm has invested in a wide range of well-known Internet ventures.

Once the VC firm receives a return from its investment, the VC must return the capital back to its investors based on the economic terms in the limited partnership agreement (LPA). Before a VC firm can receive any of the capital, it must return the original principal in its entirety to the limited partner investors plus any guaranteed return that was agreed upon in the LPA. The VC firm and the limited partners split the net profit, which is the capital that remains after the principal and the guaranteed return are returned to the limited partners.

Below is an example of how the gains are split between the VC firm and the limited partners with an investment of $100.

- **Principal investment in VC firm**: $100
- **Guaranteed return to Limited Partners**: 8%
- **Split of carried interest to VC**: 20%
- **Split of carried interest to Limited Partners**: 80%

Assume a $300 return from this $100 investment. The steps to this transaction are:

1. VC firm receives $100 from its limited partners to invest in startups.
2. VC firm takes this capital and invests $98 into various startups (2% is management fee).
3. Startups use this capital to grow their business. They later sell the business and provide a return of $300 to the VC firm.
4. VC firm takes the $300 and returns the original principal of $100 to the Limited Partners plus the required return of $8 (8% on the original $100).
5. Net Profit of $192 is left after returning $108 to limited partners ($300 - $108).
6. Net Profit is split 20% to VC Firm ($38 = 20% of $192) and 80% to Limited Partners ($154 = 80% of $192).

In summary, the limited partners receive a total of $262 getting their principal back, their required return, and a percentage of the net profit. The VC firm receives $38, a percentage of the net profit that is referred to as carried interest. The typical compensation model for a VC firm is referred to as "2 and 20". That is, 2% of the committed capital is used for the management fee and 20% of the fund’s net profits is used as carried interest. Exhibit 8.3 illustrates this set of transactions.

## 8.3.5 What do Venture Capital Firms Look For?

Venture capital firms look for many specifics in technology ventures when deciding whether to make an investment. First and foremost, they seek out experience and talent in the management team. Venture capitalists often state that they invest in the management team, not the technology. This is because no technology, no matter how revolutionary or disruptive, can be commercialized successfully without a solid management team. In addition, experienced VCs know that most technologies they invest in will change radically over time in response to changing market reactions and conditions. It is important to recognize that, when VCs evaluate the management team, they do not require that the team be devoid of past venture failures. In fact, most VCs recognize the contingent nature of venture success and do not automatically consider a past failure in a negative light.

Another primary area of consideration for VCs is the market potential for the technology. The VC wants to know if the venture is “market ready”, and they will attempt to forecast the likely marketplace demand. This will include forecasting the willingness of the customer to switch to the venture’s products based on the venture’s stated value proposition. It will also include an analysis of the size of the market opportunity. Obviously, the VC will be more interested in large market opportunities than small ones.

Another item that VCs commonly consider to be important is the time to an exit event or liquidity event. An exit event is the manner in which shareholders can convert their stock into cash (see Chapter 13 for a thorough discussion of exit strategies). This is usually achieved via acquisition by a larger company, or by going public on a major stock exchange. Either way, the capital invested by the VC is tied up until this event occurs.

In general, VCs are more risk averse than the founders of a technology venture seeking capital. In their respective evaluations of the investor readiness of the venture, the founders generally will have a more favorable perspective. VCs will evaluate a venture from both a risk and return perspective. Risk and return are evaluated in terms of the risk of venture failure and potential profitability.

The technology entrepreneur tends to have a strong interest in innovation, and will often discount the factors that VCs find important. Most technology entrepreneurs place a higher importance on the technological aspects of the opportunity and consider the management team and marketability to be of lesser importance. In fact, research has identified certain cognitive biases, such as “overconfidence”, that are common among technology entrepreneurs. Recognizing these biases is an important part of raising VC funds. The entrepreneur who does not recognize the factors that VCs consider important may not receive an adequate hearing. On the other hand, the technology entrepreneur who tailors the VC presentation to address the issues they are most concerned with enhances his or her chances of receiving funds.


## 8.4 DEBT FINANCING

Debt financing is normally provided to technology ventures via an institutional lender, such as a bank. However, this may not always be the case. Some entrepreneurs structure deals where they take loans from private parties. While this is not a common practice, some estimates indicate that as many as 10 million people in the United States have accepted private loans from people they know. Borrowing from family and friends can provide easier terms than an institutional lender, including a longer repayment period and a lower interest rate. However, borrowing from family and friends has some risks that are dissimilar from institutional lenders. For example, if the entrepreneur does not repay the loan within a reasonable amount of time, the trust of the family and/or friend lenders could be lost. Worse, if the entrepreneur defaults on repaying the loan, relationships may become strained, family ties could be severed, and lawsuits could be filed.

It is important to carefully document the terms of the business loan between friends and relatives who lend money to a venture. This can help ensure that these individuals are less apprehensive about how their money is being used. It can also prevent messy or awkward situations in the event the venture has difficulties living up to the loan covenants. If details regarding remedies for late payments and even for complete default are discussed and agreed to in advance, the impact of such eventualities can be lessened.

### 8.4.1 Institutional Lender Requirements

Institutional lenders, such as banks, can be a source of financing for young technology ventures. However, banks will require more documentation than friends and family normally require; they will also require that the venture be able to secure the loan by pledging an equivalent amount of collateral. That is, most institutional lenders reduce the risk of their loans by gaining a security interest in property owned by the borrower that is adjudged to be equivalent in value to the loan principal amount. Collateral can be any property owned by the borrower, including personal property.

It is also not uncommon for technology entrepreneurs to provide—or to be required to provide—a personal guarantee on the amount of the loan. That is done when the venture has few assets to use as collateral, but the entrepreneur has personal assets that will suffice. For example, some entrepreneurs will use their personal savings, home equity, or real estate as collateral for loans from a bank for business purposes. In the case of default, the bank would then be able to exercise its claim on the collateral in an effort to recover whatever portion of the loan remains unpaid.

### 8.4.2 Loan Rates, Payment Methods, and Lender Types

In addition to pledging collateral in the amount of the loan’s principal, institutional lenders normally require that the entrepreneur begin to pay back the loan immediately, with an added interest charge. Payments on a loan are typically made in monthly increments. The rate of interest charged to a small technology startup for a loan will exceed the rate charged to large, well-established, companies. The latter receive preferential rates from banks—usually called the prime rate—because they are less risky borrowers than a startup venture. Startup ventures will receive a rate that is termed prime plus. That is, the rate will be some measure above the prime rate depending on the risk profile of the venture and, to some extent, its principals and the collateral they are able to pledge.

Most banks will have a similar prime rate, but they will vary significantly from one to another in the rates they charge to entrepreneur borrowers. For example, some banks specialize in originating real estate or construction loans. They will typically have loan officers who are familiar with the industry and will have experience in judging the risks involved in lending to this type of venture. A bank that specializes in real estate lending may not be able to evaluate the risk involved in lending to a technology startup. It’s important for the technology entrepreneur to conduct research prior to approaching a lender to determine whether it is capable of understanding the nature of the venture and its risks. Silicon Valley Bank, for example, specializes in loans to technology ventures.

Loans made by institutions also require payback to occur over a certain period of time referred to as the term of the loan. Short-term loans will carry slightly lower interest rates than long-term loans, but they will also require larger monthly payments. Long-term loans are generally considered to be those that have a term of 10 years or greater. Different lenders use different methods to calculate loan repayment schedules depending on their needs, borrowers’ needs, the institution’s interest rate policy, the length of the loan, and the purpose of the borrowed money. Normally, business loans are paid back on a monthly schedule in equal payments throughout the term of the loan.

Institutional lenders will also usually require that the startup venture adhere to certain restrictive covenants in order to remain in good standing on the loan. Restrictive covenants enable the lender to maintain some control of the venture by specifying performance targets. In the event these performance targets are missed, the lender would have the option to call the loan. That is, it can demand complete payment of the outstanding principal before the term of the loan is completed. Restrictive covenants are of two types: positive and negative. Positive covenants specify performance targets that must be attained in order for the borrower to remain in good standing. For example, a bank and borrower may agree to establish positive covenants targeting total sales, cash flow, profitability, or others. Negative covenants establish performance floors below which the venture may not fall in order to remain in good standing. For example, the bank and the borrower may agree that the venture may not fall below target figures in sales, cash flow, the ratio of debt to equity capital in the venture, and others.

Restrictive covenants are usually determined through negotiations between the lender and the borrower, but many lenders have lending guidelines that establish in advance the covenants that they must put into any lending agreement. Technology entrepreneurs must be aware of the covenants that banks require, and determine whether they will impede the venture’s ability to succeed. For example, many businesses are subject to fluctuations in sales based on business cycles and other factors. A restrictive covenant that did not account for these sales fluctuations may result in an unnecessarily premature decision by the lender to call the loan. In a time of decreased sales, such an action could be fatal to the startup venture.

Another type of loan facility that is exceedingly useful to the startup venture is the line of credit or revolving loan. A line of credit is simply a pool of money that is set aside by a lender for a business to use as needed. The borrower can draw down the line of credit for business expenses without having to fill out a loan application each time funds are required. This saves the lender and the borrower a lot of time. Lenders provide lines of credit using the same risk calculations as any other loan, and they will also usually require collateral in the amount of the credit line. Borrowers benefit from a line of credit in that they only need to pay back the amount withdrawn, and pay interest only on the withdrawn capital. In addition to the interest collected, most banks will charge an annual maintenance fee to provide a line of credit to a company.

### 8.4.3 Small Business Administration (SBA) Loans

Another type of loan commonly used by technology startups is the Small Business Administration Loan. The name of this loan type is confusing to some. The Small Business Administration (SBA) is an agency of the United States federal government. However, the SBA does not originate the loan made to the venture. A technology entrepreneur who wants to secure an SBA loan must do so through a commercial bank that provides such loans. The bank originates the loan, and the SBA guarantees payment on the loan up to a predefined percentage of the principal amount. In this way, the SBA provides a form of collateral and takes a good deal of risk out of the loan for the bank.

While the SBA provides a credible and useful debt facility for many entrepreneurs, an SBA loan also has significant disadvantages. SBA loans generally require more documentation and disclosure on the part of the small business than does a traditional loan. SBA loans also frequently have higher interest rates than would a loan provided directly by a commercial lender. Still, there are many advantages to getting an SBA loan, not the least of which is the fact that many startup ventures have no other options. The SBA has more loan programs than the primary ones listed above, including some that are designed specifically to support minority and women-owned enterprises.

## 8.5 FUNDRAISING TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES

Fundraising for a technology venture is never a sure thing, but there are some tools and techniques that can improve the odds of acquiring needed capital. One of the primary tools of fundraising is the business plan. It is rarely possible to raise money outside of the friends and family network without a business plan. Angel investors will almost always ask to see the venture’s business plan before investing. Venture capitalists and institutional lenders will always require a business plan. Entrepreneurs should develop and maintain a business plan at all times because most startup ventures are in near-constant fundraising mode. A good business plan will describe the venture and its technologies in terms the investor or lender can understand and evaluate.

Another tool that should be part of the technology entrepreneur’s fundraising arsenal is the executive summary. The executive summary is an abridged version of the business plan, normally condensed down to a single page.

### 8.5.1 Private Placement Memorandum

Private equity fundraising requires that the venture prepare what is referred to as a private placement memorandum (PPM). The PPM is a legal document that specifies all the risks associated with investing in the venture, including the potential for complete loss of all invested capital. The PPM also specifies the amount of capital that is to be raised, the type of security being offered, and the rights and privileges associated with investing. 

Most early stage fundraising will divide the amount to be raised into investment units. For example, if a venture is raising $500,000 and selling its stock for $1.00/share, it does not want 500,000 individuals each purchasing one share. That would be an administrative nightmare. Instead, the venture would sell the $1.00/share stock in units of, say, $25,000. That means that anyone interested in investing would need to purchase at least one unit.

In addition to stating the amount that is going to be raised, the PPM will often specify the minimum amount that needs to be raised in order for the venture to be able to use the funds. This is often referred to as the min/max. This concept can be understood most clearly from the perspective of the investor. If an investor puts money into a venture, he or she wants to be sure that the venture has a fair chance of success. However, if the venture raises only a small portion of what it needs, it may fail. The min/max specifies the minimum amount of money that is required for the venture to have a fair chance to succeed. The venture does not use any of the funds it raises until it achieves the minimum amount. Funds raised prior to reaching the minimum are held in trust in a bank account. Once the minimum has been raised, the venture is allowed to break the bank and begin to use the invested capital.

### 8.5.2 Subscription Agreement

The final document to include in equity fundraising is the subscription agreement. A subscription agreement is a document that a potential investor signs, indicating an intent to invest at a certain amount. Even though a subscription document is not considered to be binding on the potential investor, it creates a psychological commitment on the part of the investor. For example, imagine that a technology entrepreneur completes a lengthy presentation to an angel investor in their office. The investor indicates an interest, but would prefer to look over the business plan and PPM before making a decision. If the entrepreneur walks out of the office with no signed commitment, the potential investor may not be interested enough to continue thinking about the deal. It is far more influential to have a signed agreement when conducting follow up conversations, including the penultimate conversation where the entrepreneur asks for the check, than it is merely to have a promise.


### 8.6 ALTERNATIVES TO DEBT AND EQUITY FINANCING

While the primary sources of capital for the startup venture are the sources of debt and equity discussed above, there are alternatives. Many technology ventures are able to get started and fund operations using government grants as their primary revenue source. Next, we look at two government grant programs available to the technology venture, and also at bootstrap financing, which relies on internal cash only to grow the venture.

#### 8.6.1 Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)

One particular type of government grant that is commonly used by technology ventures is the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program. The U.S. Small Business Administration’s Office of Technology administers the SBIR program. SBIR is a competitive program that encourages small businesses to explore their technological potential and provides the incentive to profit from its commercialization. Since its enactment in 1982, and as part of the Small Business Innovation Development Act, SBIR has helped thousands of small businesses to compete for federal research and development awards. Small businesses must meet certain eligibility criteria to participate in the SBIR program:

- American-owned and independently operated
- For-profit
- Principal researcher employed by business
- Company size limited to 500 employees

Each year, eleven federal departments and agencies are required by SBIR to reserve a portion of their R&D funds for award to small business investments, including:

- Department of Agriculture
- Department of Commerce
- Department of Defense
- Department of Education
- Department of Energy
- Department of Health and Human Services
- Department of Homeland Security
- Department of Transportation
- Environmental Protection Agency
- National Aeronautics and Space Administration
- National Science Foundation

These agencies designate R&D topics and accept proposals. Following submission of proposals, agencies make SBIR awards based on small business qualification, degree of innovation, technical merit, and future market potential. Small businesses that receive awards then begin a three-phase program.

- **Phase I** is the startup phase. Awards of up to $100,000 for approximately six months support exploration of the technical merit or feasibility of an idea or technology.
- **Phase II** awards of up to $750,000, for as many as 2 years, expand Phase I results. During this time, the R&D work is performed and the developer evaluates commercialization potential. Only Phase I award winners are considered for Phase II.
- **Phase III** is the period during which Phase II innovation moves from the laboratory into the marketplace. No SBIR funds support this phase. The small business must find funding in the private sector or other non-SBIR federal agency funding.

#### 8.6.2 Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR)

Another grant program offered by the SBA is the Small Business Technology Transfer Program (STTR). Central to this program is expansion of the public/private sector partnership to include joint venture opportunities for small business and nonprofit research institutions. The STTR program reserves a specific percentage of federal R&D funding to offer awards to small business and nonprofit research institution partners. The STTR program combines the strengths of both entities by introducing entrepreneurial skills to high-tech research efforts. The idea is that the small business partner is able to transfer from the laboratory to the marketplace the technologies and products developed within the non-profit organization. Small businesses must meet certain eligibility criteria, just like the SBIR program to participate in the STTR Program:

- Must be American-owned and independently operated.
- Must be for-profit.
- Principal researcher does not need to be employed by small business.
- Company size is limited to 500 employees.

The nonprofit research institution partner must also meet certain eligibility criteria. It must:

- Be located in the United States.
- Meet one of three definitions.
  - Be a nonprofit college or university.
  - Be a domestic nonprofit research organization.
  - Be a federally funded R&D center (FFRDC).

Each year, five federal departments and agencies are required by STTR to reserve a portion of their R&D funds for awarding to small business or nonprofit research institution partnerships:

- Department of Defense
- Department of Energy
- Department of Health and Human Services
- National Aeronautics and Space Administration
- National Science Foundation

These agencies designate R&D topics and accept proposals. Following submission of proposals, agencies make STTR awards based on small business or nonprofit research institution qualifications, degree of innovation, and future market potential. Small businesses that receive awards then begin a three-phase program.

- **Phase I** is the start-up phase. Awards of up to $100,000 for approximately one year fund the exploration of the scientific, technical, and commercial feasibility of an idea or technology.
- **Phase II** awards of up to $750,000 for as many as two years expand Phase I results. During this period, the R&D work is performed and the developer begins to consider commercial potential. Only Phase I award winners are considered for Phase II.
- **Phase III** is the period during which Phase II innovation moves from the laboratory into the marketplace. No STTR funds support this phase. The small business must find funding in the private sector or find other non-STTR federal agency funding.

#### 8.6.3 Bootstrap Financing

Another way that start-up technology ventures finance their growth is through what is often referred to as bootstrap financing. Here, the company uses its own sales and cash flows to invest in its growth. This type of internal growth is also referred to as organic growth. That is, the company grows only by virtue of its own ability to sell, control costs, and reinvest profits.

Bootstrap financing has the advantage of helping the firm steer clear of the dilutive effects of equity financing and the debt burden effects of debt financing. The primary disadvantage of this type of financing is that it limits the venture’s ability to grow rapidly. That could be a major disadvantage for technology ventures in highly competitive industries where acquiring market share is the key to long-term success.

#### 8.6.4 Licensing

One of the tools available to technology-based companies to self-finance their growth is licensing third parties to use their technology in return for some consideration. That consideration typically takes the form of money (although it can be other things such as, e.g., access to needed resources, or a cross license to use the third party’s technology).

If done strategically, licenses to third parties can be granted without diminishing the competitive advantage that your company obtains from the licensed technology. For example, the license can be limited to a particular market other than your target markets. Or, the license can be for a limited time period and also limited to a geographic region outside of the region that you can reasonably anticipate being able to service during that time period. Or, the license can be limited to sales channels that you have no reasonable capacity to service, or product lines that, for whatever reason, you have no interest in pursuing.

In some instances, licensing can be a viable alternative to raising capital, and, in fact, can sometimes be the basis for a company’s business model.

### 8.7 CHAPTER SUMMARY

This chapter examined the sources of financing available to technology ventures throughout their lifetimes. During the early stages of the venture’s life, friends and family are the primary sources of capital beyond the founders’ own finances. As the firm begins to grow and develop sales, other avenues of financing might open. Angel financing becomes available when the firm is able to tell a more compelling story about its growth prospects, especially if it already has significant sales and well-known clients. In addition, firms that have developed collateral such as physical assets or highly regarded contracts may be eligible for debt financing. Commercial lenders, such as banks, are risk averse and lend only when there are assurances that the venture can pay back the principal with interest.

Raising capital is normally never ending for technology venture entrepreneurs. Maturing ventures seeking equity capital from angel investors must prepare legal documentation and sell shares in compliance with Securities and Exchange Commission rules. This chapter examined several rules that enable raising private equity from accredited investors. The most common capital raises for growing ventures, conducted under the SEC’s Regulation D. Rules 504, 505, and 506, offer different frameworks for raising equity capital. Each rule shelters the venture from overbearing disclosure requirements that are required of public companies that sell shares to the investing public. The rules do require that ventures develop standard disclosure documents such as a private placement memorandum (PPM). The PPM will disclose all of the risks associated with investing in the venture and detail the terms of the stock offering. In addition to the PPM, technology entrepreneurs typically also provide a business plan and executive summary to interested investors when raising capital.

Raising equity capital requires that the venture establish some reasonable valuation to determine ownership percentages. Valuation is an imprecise science, with several acceptable methods available. Each method is likely to produce a different valuation. Ultimately, the entrepreneur and investors negotiate a valuation they can agree to. The agreed valuation is referred to as the premoney valuation. After the investment is made, the postmoney valuation is used to calculate the relative ownership shares of founders and investors. Founders who hold stock at the time of the investment will have their ownership percentages diluted based on the amount of investment received.

The chapter also discussed options to debt and equity financing, focusing on several opportunities for nonrecourse government grants. The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs are excellent sources of financing for ventures that are in the research and development stage.



# Chapter 9: Launching the Venture

## 9.1 Introduction
The success of a technology venture depends on effective strategy at multiple levels:
1. **Enterprise-level strategy**: Focuses on relationships between the venture and society (mission, business model).
2. **Corporate-level strategy**: Deals with diversification and managing a portfolio of products/markets (more relevant after launch).
3. **Business-level strategy**: Involves competing in an industry, acquiring resources, and growing the venture (immediate importance).
4. **Functional-level strategy**: Covers core operational areas like marketing, accounting, finance, and HR (essential for day-to-day operations).

This chapter focuses on business-level and functional-level strategies, with an emphasis on market entry, penetration strategies, and planning.

# 9.2 Market Entry Positioning

Market entry positioning helps entrepreneurs establish a foothold in a market. Key strategies include:

1. **Product Uniqueness**: Emphasize the unique aspects of a new technology to attract attention (e.g., RED camera’s digital technology). Combining a unique product with related services can create a leadership position.

2. **Parallel Competitive Parity**: Target underserved market niches with a product that isn't radically unique but improves upon existing offerings (e.g., TaskRabbit).

3. **Customer Orientation**: Focus on evolving customer needs and preferences. Target new or dissatisfied customers (e.g., Lincoln's shift to a younger audience, Arnolite Pallet Company’s alternative supply strategy).

4. **Government Information**: Leverage new regulations or government programs that offer support or create market opportunities (e.g., safety equipment mandates, Small Business Administration programs).

# 9.3 Market Penetration Strategy

A market penetration strategy focuses on increasing market share within an existing market by:

- Encouraging frequent purchases.
- Offering referral rewards to expand customer base.

Once market saturation is reached, the company can introduce new products or expand into new markets.

**Examples:**
- A company selling bark mulch used referrals to boost sales, then introduced other products.
- Color Lines Clothing expanded by exporting high-quality, unique children’s clothing, starting with Australia and growing through customer loyalty.

# Mini-Case: Apple Excels as First Mover

Apple has been a successful first mover, launching groundbreaking products like the iPod (2001), iTunes (2003), iPhone (2007), and iPad (2010). By creating proprietary technologies and raising barriers to entry, Apple built brand loyalty and maintained a competitive edge over quickly-following rivals.

# 9.3.1 First Mover Advantage

A first mover advantage occurs when a technology entrepreneur launches a new product or service before competitors, resulting in various benefits:

1. **Cost Advantage**: The first mover can benefit from economies of scale, lowering costs through experience and larger production volumes.

2. **Reduced Competition**: Being first means facing fewer competitors initially. This advantage diminishes as competitors enter the market, unless exclusive intellectual property is secured.

3. **Supply & Distribution Channels**: First movers can establish strong relationships with suppliers and distributors, sometimes securing exclusive contracts that act as barriers to entry for competitors.

4. **Experience**: Early market entry provides valuable experience, enabling the improvement of products and the development of new offerings for satisfied customers.

5. **Switching Costs**: First movers can create switching costs through marketing and customer loyalty, making it more difficult for customers to switch to competing products.

# 9.4 Value Chain Analysis

Value chain analysis helps technology entrepreneurs understand the integrated activities that create value in a market. Key steps include:

1. **Identify Market Leaders**: Determine which activities add value for leading companies (e.g., product features, distribution, service quality).

2. **Understand Costs & Structures**: Analyze key customers, suppliers, and channel members to identify costs and opportunities for innovation.

3. **Develop New Value Chain**: Identify problems in the existing value chain that can be solved by creating a new value chain, providing greater value to consumers.

# 9.5 Developing a Contingency Plan

A contingency plan helps entrepreneurs respond to market changes, product introductions, or shifts in consumer preferences. To stay resilient:

- **Maintain High Quality**: Use continuous improvement, benchmarking, and outsourcing to maintain high-quality standards.
- **Prepare for Change**: Develop strategies for both economic downturns and growth, anticipating potential market disruptions.

# Mini-Case: Lincoln Motor Company Raises Quality in New Model

In 2006, Lincoln launched the MKZ to target younger luxury car buyers. Priced between $29,995 and $35,575, it sold over 7,000 units in its first quarter, attracting buyers with an average age of 56, much younger than typical Lincoln buyers. The MKZ was updated with new versions in 2007 and 2010, and a hybrid version was released in 2011, becoming the most fuel-efficient luxury vehicle in the U.S. by 2013.

# 9.6 Growing Beyond the Startup

**Corporate Entrepreneurship**: This concept, also known as intrapreneurship, involves individuals within an organization creating new opportunities to improve the company’s competitive position. It involves innovation, ownership, creativity, and change.

### Formula for Corporate Entrepreneurship:
- **I = Innovation**
- **O = Ownership**
- **C = Creativity**
- **C = Change**

## 9.6.1 Innovation
Innovation is vital for survival and growth, taking three forms:
1. **Ordinary Innovation**: Small changes like product improvements or packaging tweaks.
2. **Technological Innovation**: Advancements that enhance products or services and may involve patents or trademarks.
3. **Breakthrough Innovation**: Radical changes that transform industries (e.g., personal computers, cell phones, the Internet).

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d4765c35-edbe-4493-b531-5ad3f93e3194)



## 9.6.2 Ownership
Ownership in a company culture means employees feel responsible for their work and strive to perform efficiently. This sense of ownership helps prevent competition from gaining a foothold.

## 9.6.3 Creativity
Creativity encourages the development of unique ideas, often driven by problem-solving techniques:
- **Brainstorming**: Group idea generation without criticism.
- **Reverse Brainstorming**: Focus on negative aspects to solve problems.
- **Brainwriting**: Silent written idea generation.
- **Gordon Method**: Start with a general concept and refine ideas.
- **Checklist Method**: Use a list of related questions to guide idea development.
- **Free Association**: Chain of words or phrases to develop new ideas.
- **Forced Relationships**: Combine unrelated products or concepts to generate new ideas.
- **Collective Notebook**: Participants write down ideas over time and meet to discuss.
- **Attribute Listing**: View a problem from multiple perspectives to create new solutions.
- **Big-Dream Approach**: Think freely without constraints.
- **Parameter Analysis**: Identify key factors and develop solutions within those parameters.


## 9.6.4 Change

For a technology venture to survive and grow, **change** must be continuously allowed and encouraged. Change should occur in small, incremental steps to ensure smooth adoption. The benefits of implementing corporate entrepreneurship include:
- High performance culture and better morale
- Employee turnover reduction
- Motivated workforce
- New business concepts
- New ways of doing things
- Flexible organizational structure
- Organizational learning
- Positive impact on revenues and profits

Employees benefit from:
- Self-achievement
- Job satisfaction
- Increased skills
- Financial and non-financial rewards
- Excitement and increased creativity

### 9.7 Chapter Summary
This chapter discusses launching a venture with the goal of achieving a positive cash flow. Key topics include:
1. **Entry Positioning Strategies**: Focusing on product aspects, competitive parity, customer orientation, and government info.
2. **Penetration Strategy**: Key to quickly gaining market share.
3. **First Mover Advantage**: Early entry advantages such as cost advantages and less competition.

## Chapter 10: Marketing and Selling Your Products

### Persistent Marketing and Selling: Launch of Square

Square Inc., founded in 2009 by Jack Dorsey (Twitter co-founder), began with a list of 140 reasons why it might fail and counterpoints to each. The company’s first product, the **Card Reader**, allowed businesses to accept credit card payments via smartphones. It solved the problem of small businesses unable to accept card payments, stemming from an incident involving a lost sale for co-founder Jim McKelvey.

Square's success relied on obtaining approval from major credit card companies to act as an aggregator (like PayPal). By offering a **2.75% per swipe** fee or a flat fee for low-volume merchants, it gained traction. Square’s innovation continued with the **Square Wallet** app, allowing customers to pay just by stating their names. Despite competition, Square raised over $341 million and was valued at $3.25 billion in 2013.

### 10.1 Introduction

Customer focus, problem-solving technology, and strategic marketing are key to successful launches. Square’s success is attributed to understanding and satisfying customer needs, motivating employees to create superior value. This chapter explores the process of delivering customer satisfaction through marketing, including target market selection, consumer purchasing, and the marketing mix.

### 10.2 Target Market Selection

Target market selection helps technology entrepreneurs focus on profitable customer segments. To be effective, the target group should be of sufficient size, reachable, and satisfy customer needs. Customer satisfaction is based on the product’s performance meeting or exceeding expectations. Satisfied customers lead to repeat business and word-of-mouth advertising. **Customer value** is the difference between the value derived from the product and the costs of obtaining it.

### 10.3 Purchasing the Product or Service

Customer expectations are shaped by past experiences, competition, product performance, and others' opinions. By meeting or exceeding these expectations, a company can deliver customer value.

The purchasing process consists of five stages: 
1. **Need recognition** – The customer realizes a need, triggered by internal (e.g., hunger) or external (e.g., seeing a new product) stimuli.
2. **Information search** – Customers gather information from four sources: personal sources, personal experience, public information, or commercial information.
3. **Information evaluation** – The customer evaluates the information to assess the quality, characteristics, and utility of the product or service to meet their needs. The goal is to find the best quality at the best cost.
4. **Purchase decision** – Based on evaluation, the customer decides whether or not to purchase, influenced by social factors and personal assessment of satisfaction.
5. **Post-purchase behavior** – After the purchase, customers assess if they are satisfied or experience cognitive dissonance due to unmet expectations or new information. Handling dissatisfaction is crucial for repeat purchases.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df2abccd-e398-4c84-9554-e187b5065a57)


The **adoption curve** categorizes customers into five groups based on when they make a purchase:
- **Innovators** and **Early adopters** (quick to buy)
- **Late adopters** and **Conservatives**
- **Laggards** (slow to buy)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6002fd99-5644-4a70-9242-1d2332dcef9b)

In disruptive technologies, there is often a "chasm" between early adopters and the larger, more conservative market. Bridging this gap requires strategic marketing.

### 10.4 Marketing

Marketing is defined as the process of making decisions in a dynamic business environment to facilitate exchanges that satisfy the customer while achieving company objectives. The goal is to focus on satisfying the target market and ensuring that all marketing activities support this aim.

#### Mini-Case: Whole Foods Differentiates on GMO Labeling
In 2013, Whole Foods became the first U.S. grocery chain to mandate GMO labeling on all products by 2018. This move capitalized on growing consumer skepticism about GMOs, particularly among health-conscious buyers, and helped differentiate Whole Foods as a leader in transparency.

#### 10.4.1 The Marketing Mix
The marketing mix involves the controllable activities used to facilitate exchanges. It consists of four main components, known as the **4 P’s**:
- **Product Mix**: Decisions regarding the product’s quality, variety, packaging, and service elements.
- **Price Mix**: The pricing strategy for the product.
- **Placement (Distribution) Mix**: How the product is made available to customers.
- **Promotion Mix**: The tactics used to promote the product to the target audience.

#### 10.4.2 Product Mix
The product mix includes decisions about product quality, design, features, and service. Entrepreneurs must focus on creating a **core product** that meets customer needs, then enhance it into an actual marketable product. This involves factors like design, brand name, and packaging. For example, the Apple iPhone is more than just a phone; it’s a multimedia device that integrates various features, quality, and design.

- **Branding**: A brand name should be easy to pronounce, memorable, and suggestive of the product’s benefits or qualities. For instance, Whole Foods’ logo suggests the natural aspect of its products.
  
- **Packaging**: Packaging plays a vital role in attracting customers and protecting the product. It should also comply with legal requirements and fit production needs. Some packaging innovations involve interactive features, like Tetra Pak’s juice cartons with scanable characters.

- **After-Sales Service**: Critical for customer satisfaction, particularly for technical products. Services like guarantees, returns, and easy access to customer support enhance the overall product experience. For instance, Best Buy’s Geek Squad provides an extra layer of service for computers, contributing to customer loyalty.

### 10.4.3 Pricing

Pricing is often the most challenging aspect of the marketing mix for entrepreneurs. Internal factors influencing pricing decisions include:
- **Objectives**: These can range from acquiring quick sales and maximizing cash flow to establishing a strong market position or signaling quality.
- **Other elements of the marketing mix**: Pricing must align with product, distribution, and promotion strategies to ensure consistency.

Entrepreneurs should ideally focus on the product's features and uniqueness, rather than just setting a low price. A good pricing strategy is not necessarily the lowest price but one that reflects the value the product offers through its features.

#### The 3 C’s of Pricing:
1. **Cost**: This sets the price floor. The price must cover fixed and variable costs, including production, distribution, and marketing expenses. 
   - **Fixed costs** (overhead): Costs that do not vary with production, like R&D.
   - **Variable costs** (COGS): Costs that change with production volume, such as materials and labor.

2. **Competition**: Competitors’ pricing provides a boundary. A deep understanding of competing products helps set a competitive price and anticipate market responses.

3. **Consumer**: Ultimately, consumers determine the success of the pricing strategy. The price must reflect perceived value, which motivates the consumer to make a purchase.

#### Pricing Strategies:
- **Market-Skimming Pricing**: Set a high initial price to capture more revenue from early adopters. This strategy works when:
  - The product's image supports a premium price.
  - High R&D and initial production costs need to be recovered.
  - Competitors cannot easily enter the market.
  - Example: Apple iPhone, Intel chips.

- **Market-Penetration Pricing**: Set a low initial price to quickly capture market share. This strategy is effective when:
  - A lower price encourages higher sales.
  - Production costs will decrease significantly as volume increases.
  - The product has a short lifecycle or loses its distinctiveness quickly.

### 10.4.4 Placement (Distribution)

Distribution is a critical part of the marketing mix, involving two key components: **channels of distribution** and **physical distribution**.

#### Channels of Distribution
A distribution channel consists of independent organizations that work together to make a product available to customers. These channels provide functions like contact, marketing, promotion, information, financing, risk-taking, and negotiation. However, each channel member adds costs, which increases the selling price to the customer. 

- **Channel Members**: Retailers and wholesalers are the primary channel members.
- **Manufacturer Agents/Brokers**: These agents help technology companies by selling products on commission. They don’t take ownership of the product but help market it to potential buyers, often aiding in overcoming cash flow challenges for startups.

The **markups** from channel members are based on the selling price, not just the cost. A product priced at $1.00 can increase from $1.20 (direct) to $1.98 depending on the number of intermediaries and their markups.

#### Physical Distribution
Physical distribution involves the movement of the product to the customer, including storage, inventory management, transportation, and warehousing. Efficient physical distribution is crucial for customer service, as delays or stock-outs can lead to significant issues and costs. With increasing transportation costs, efficient logistics is becoming more important.

- **Supply Chain Management**: This approach ensures better customer service at lower costs through teamwork within the company and with external partners (suppliers, channel members, and customers). Effective logistics management can maximize the performance of the distribution system.

### 10.4.5 Promotion

Promotion is the final element of the marketing mix and involves managing five key areas:

1. **Advertising**: Paid communication to promote a product. This includes media selection (e.g., TV, radio, magazines) and message development. Technology entrepreneurs should consider cooperative advertising to share costs with channel members.

2. **Personal Selling**: A personal presentation of the product to individuals or groups, done face-to-face, by phone, or online. This includes selection, training, compensation, territories, and control for sales teams.

3. **Sales Promotion**: A diverse range of non-advertising promotional activities such as coupons, samples, trade shows, sweepstakes, and point-of-sale materials. This area is increasing in popularity and offers a creative way to promote technology products.

4. **Publicity**: Non-paid promotion, often seen as more credible than paid ads. Publicity involves favorable media coverage through news releases, product features, or company events. Word-of-mouth and public endorsements from figures like Steve Jobs can significantly impact sales.

5. **Social Media**: A vital promotion tool in the digital age, involving platforms like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube, and blogs. Social media is crucial for building e-marketing presence, customer engagement, and conducting market research. Companies use social media to monitor customer feedback, influence product development, and drive sales.
