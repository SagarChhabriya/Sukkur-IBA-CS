# Chapter 6 Choice of Legal Strcuture

### 6.1 Introduction

Building a technology venture often requires a team. While a founder (or inventor) may come up with the idea, they typically need to recruit others to provide skills, expertise, or credibility to make the business viable. These individuals may be offered equity in the company instead of full compensation, especially in start-ups where cash is limited. The equity given depends on each person's contribution to the venture.

The decisions made at the founding stage—such as the legal structure and how equity is distributed—are critical for attracting investors and co-venturers, as well as for ensuring the venture’s financial success.

### 6.2 OWNERSHIP AND LIABILITY ISSUES

A start-up is usually owned by one or more individuals or entities, called founders, who contribute to the business in exchange for equity (ownership). Later contributors are referred to as investors or lenders. In the U.S., a business can take several legal forms, such as:

- Sole proprietorship
- General partnership
- Limited partnership (LP)
- Limited liability company (LLC)
- Corporation (C-corporation or S-corporation)

Other structures like cooperatives or nonprofits also exist but are generally based on one of the above types. The choice of structure impacts the business in various ways, including the risk to owners, growth potential, available benefits, taxation, and exit strategies. One key factor is the liability of the owners, with some structures offering limited liability and others not.

### 6.2.1 Limited Versus Unlimited Liability

Certain business entities, like sole proprietorships and general partnerships, are considered "unlimited liability" entities. This means that owners (sole proprietors or partners) are personally responsible for all the business's debts and liabilities. Their personal assets are at risk, even for obligations they didn’t directly create. In legal terms, owners are "jointly and severally liable," meaning they can be held fully responsible for the business's debts.

Additionally, owners of unlimited liability entities are vicariously liable for the actions of employees or other partners, even if they were not personally involved. This issue has led to the creation of limited liability entities, such as corporations, LLCs, and LPs, which limit owners' liability to the amount they invested in the business. These entities help protect personal assets and promote business growth by making it easier to attract investors.

The purpose of limited liability entities is to encourage investment, as it would be hard to find investors for a business where their entire personal wealth could be at risk. Limited liability reduces the financial risk for investors, making it easier for ventures to secure the capital needed for growth.


### 6.2.2 The Extent of Limited Liability

The primary reason for establishing a venture as a limited liability entity is to protect the personal assets of principals and managers from the business's financial and legal issues. If the business is properly formed and its managers act responsibly, they are shielded from personal liability for the business's debts and obligations.

For example, if an employee orders goods on credit for the business and the company cannot pay, the employee is not personally liable. If the business is a limited liability entity, only the business itself is liable for the debt, not the owners. However, if an individual commits wrongdoing, such as making fraudulent misrepresentations, they could be personally liable regardless of the business structure.

Limited liability protection is commonly referred to as the "corporate veil," which protects the personal assets of the owners. However, courts will disregard this protection in cases of criminal acts or if the business fails to properly file taxes, such as payroll taxes. A single-member LLC, for instance, does not protect the owner from personal liability for unpaid taxes.

Additionally, there are situations where limited liability protection can be pierced, and owners can be held personally liable, even without personal wrongdoing. This can happen if:

- The business entity was not properly formed.
- Legal formalities are not observed, such as treating the business as a separate entity.
- The business was set up with fraudulent intent, or if the owners misuse company assets or engage in fraud.

Other actions that can lead to disregarding limited liability protection include:

- Incurring debt when the company is insolvent.
- Improperly using company funds for personal purposes.
- Commingling company assets with personal assets.
- Engaging in fraudulent activities.

Certain statutory obligations, such as tax withholding, environmental laws, or violations of securities laws, can also lead to personal liability for business debts.

With these considerations in mind, entrepreneurs can make an informed decision about the legal structure of their new venture.

### 6.3 Choice of Legal Structure

Each business entity has unique features, with different advantages and disadvantages depending on the specific needs of the venture. Consider the following factors when choosing the best legal structure:

- **Risks and Liabilities**: Limited liability entities protect participants by limiting their exposure to the assets they contribute to the business.
- **Participants**: Some business structures have restrictions on the number and types of participants allowed.
- **Capital Growth Needs**: Some entities are better suited to raising large amounts of capital from multiple sources.
- **Management Structure**: Some business forms offer more flexibility in how they are managed.
- **Tax Implications**: Different entity structures may have varying tax consequences depending on the jurisdiction.
- **Regulatory Burden**: Securities laws impact some business types more than others.
- **Administrative Burden and Expenses**: Some entities require formal documentation and filings, which can involve more time and costs.
- **Survivability**: Some structures may terminate under certain conditions, while others persist longer.
- **Privacy**: Certain entities require public disclosure of business and financial information.
- **Exit Strategy and Liquidity**: Some structures offer more flexibility for withdrawing or liquidating the business.

Business structures range from sole proprietorships to publicly held corporations. We will now look at each in detail, exploring the advantages and disadvantages of each option.

# 6.3.1 Sole Proprietorship

A **sole proprietorship** is the simplest form of business. It is created when an individual owns and operates a business without following formal entity creation processes. The business is not legally separate from the owner, and the owner is personally responsible for all debts, liabilities, and obligations.

### Key Points:
- **Ownership & Management**: Owned and managed by one individual (or a married couple for tax purposes).
- **Taxation**: The business's income is reported on the owner's personal tax return and taxed at the personal rate. The owner is also subject to self-employment taxes.
- **Formation**: Simple to set up, requiring minimal formalities like fictitious name registration and necessary business licenses.
- **Liability**: The owner has unlimited personal liability for business debts and employee actions.

### Advantages:
- **Simplicity and Low Cost**: Easy to establish with minimal formalities.
- **Complete Control**: The owner has full decision-making authority.
- **Pass-through Taxation**: Income and losses are reported on the owner's personal return.

### Disadvantages:
- **Unlimited Liability**: Personal assets are at risk for business obligations.
- **Limited Capital Raising**: The business relies solely on the owner's resources.
- **Self-employment Taxes**: The owner must pay self-employment taxes on business income.

A sole proprietorship is ideal for small businesses with minimal risks but comes with the downside of unlimited liability.


# 6.3.2 General Partnership

A **general partnership** is formed when profits and losses are shared by two or more individuals or entities. It is considered a partnership unless statutory entity formalities are followed. In a general partnership, each partner has unlimited personal liability for the business's debts and obligations.

### Key Points:
- **Ownership & Management**: Typically defined by a partnership agreement. In the absence of an agreement, partners have equal say in management.
- **Liability**: Partners are jointly and severally liable, meaning each partner can be held responsible for the entire business debt.
- **Taxation**: The business does not pay taxes directly. Instead, income, losses, and gains pass through to partners and are taxed at the individual level.
- **Formation**: Formed by an agreement between partners (either oral or written). A partnership can also be formed by representing the business as such to the public.

### Advantages:
- **Simplicity**: Easy to form and manage with minimal formalities.
- **Flexibility**: Partners can decide profit distribution and management roles.
- **Pass-through Taxation**: Income, gains, and losses pass through to partners, avoiding double taxation.

### Disadvantages:
- **Unlimited Liability**: Partners are personally responsible for the debts and obligations of the business.
- **Vicarious Liability**: Partners are liable for each other's actions.
- **Self-employment Taxes**: Partners must pay self-employment taxes on their share of the business income.

A general partnership is suitable for businesses where multiple parties want to share profits and responsibilities but it comes with significant liability risks.


# 6.3.3 Limited Partnership

A **Limited Partnership (LP)** consists of one or more general partners and one or more limited partners. It is created by filing a certificate of LP with the state and establishing a limited partnership agreement.

### Key Points:
- **General Partners**: Responsible for managing the business and are personally liable for the partnership’s debts.
- **Limited Partners**: Passive investors with liability limited to their investment. Any active involvement may convert them into general partners.
- **Liability**: General partners have unlimited liability, while limited partners' liability is restricted to their investment.
- **Management**: Managed by general partners. Limited partners cannot take part in management without risking their limited liability status.
- **Taxation**: Profits and losses pass through to partners and are taxed at the individual level, whether or not profits are distributed.

### Advantages:
- **Limited Liability for Limited Partners**: Limited partners' personal assets are protected beyond their investment.
- **Flexibility**: Tailored management and profit-sharing arrangements.
- **Pass-through Taxation**: No double taxation as income is taxed at the individual level.

### Disadvantages:
- **Unlimited Liability for General Partners**: General partners are fully responsible for business debts.
- **Limited Management Rights**: Limited partners cannot participate in day-to-day management.
- **Self-employment Taxes**: General partners may be subject to self-employment taxes.

An LP is suitable for ventures where passive investors want to limit their risk while providing active partners with management control.

# 6.3.4 Corporation

A **Corporation** is a legal entity separate from its owners, created under state law. Corporations are formed by filing articles of incorporation (or charter) with a government agency. 

### Structure:
- **Board of Directors**: Responsible for oversight and fiduciary duties to shareholders.
- **Officers**: Manage day-to-day operations.
- **Equity Interests**: Represented by shares or stock certificates. Shareholders' liability is limited to their investment.

### Key Points:
- **Limited Liability**: Shareholders are only liable to the extent of their shareholding.
- **Corporation vs. Shareholders**: A shareholder can be an employee and receive a salary subject to payroll taxes. Dividends are not subject to payroll or self-employment tax.

### U.S. Tax Laws:
- **C-Corporation**: Taxed as a separate entity. Double taxation occurs—taxed first at the corporate level, then on dividends at the shareholder level.
- **S-Corporation**: Profits and losses pass through to shareholders. Restrictions include a maximum of 100 shareholders, only natural persons, and no nonresident aliens as shareholders.

### Notable Considerations:
- **Double Taxation (C-Corporations)**: Corporate income is taxed first, and dividends are taxed again when distributed to shareholders.
- **Retained Earnings**: Income retained for reinvestment must have valid business reasons, or it may incur additional taxes.
- **S-Corporations**: Pass-through taxation, subject to certain shareholder limits.

### Tax Benefits:
- **Small Business C-Corporations**: May qualify for tax incentives if they meet specific criteria (e.g., receiving less than $1 million in stock value).

Corporations are ideal for ventures with many passive investors or plans for public offerings.

# 6.3.4.3 Maintaining Corporate Status

To maintain corporate status, certain legal formalities must be consistently observed. Failure to do so can result in the courts disregarding the corporation's separate legal status, potentially holding owners and officers personally liable.

### Key Practices:
- **File Organizational Papers**: Ensure correct filing of documents to establish the corporation.
- **Issuing Stocks**: Proper issuance of stock to shareholders.
- **Bylaws**: Instituting and adhering to corporate bylaws.
- **Annual Filings**: Submit required annual reports to the state.
- **Meetings**: Hold annual shareholder and board meetings.
- **Minutes**: Maintain minutes of meetings and significant resolutions.
- **Corporate Records**: Keep up-to-date corporate records.
- **Separate Funds**: Maintain distinct financial records and assets for the corporation.
- **Adequate Capitalization**: Ensure the corporation is adequately capitalized to operate as a business.
- **Avoid Personal Use**: Do not use corporate assets for personal purposes unless properly documented.

### Importance of Minutes:
- **Minutes of Meetings**: Record the actions of the board or shareholders, even if no meeting occurs (unanimous written actions).
- **Review**: Minutes should be reviewed and approved by the board or shareholders at subsequent meetings.
- **Document Compliance**: Ensure that meetings follow bylaws (e.g., quorum, notice, and votes).
  
By maintaining these practices, the corporation’s legal status is protected, and the risk of “piercing the corporate veil” is minimized.

# 6.3.5 Limited Liability Company (LLC)

An LLC is a business entity that combines elements of both corporations and partnerships. It is owned by "members" and can be managed by the members themselves or by appointed "managers," who may or may not be members.

### LLC History:
- The LLC was first introduced in Wyoming in 1977.
- It gained popularity in the 1990s when the IRS ruled that LLCs could be treated as partnerships for tax purposes, even with limited liability for members.
- In 1997, the IRS introduced the "check-the-box" regulations, allowing LLCs to choose their tax treatment as a sole proprietorship, partnership, C-corporation, or S-corporation.

### LLC Characteristics:
- **Creation**: Formed by filing articles of organization with a state agency and entering an operating agreement.
- **Ownership**: Ownership is typically expressed as percentages or units, without certificates representing shares.
- **Limited Liability**: Like a corporation, members' liability is limited to the value of their ownership interest in the LLC.
- **No Formalities**: LLCs are not required to hold annual meetings or file annual reports, though regular meetings can be beneficial.

### Taxation:
- **Tax Flexibility**: LLCs can choose their tax treatment:
  - **Sole Proprietorship** (single-member LLC)
  - **Partnership** (multi-member LLC)
  - **C-Corporation** or **S-Corporation** (if elected)
- If treated as a **sole proprietorship** or **partnership**, members are subject to self-employment tax.
- If treated as a **C-corporation** or **S-corporation**, members can be employees and receive salaries subject to payroll taxes, but distributions are not subject to self-employment tax.

### Advantages & Disadvantages:
- LLCs offer significant flexibility and liability protection, but some states (like California) charge higher fees for LLCs.

# 6.3.6 Limited Liability Entities—A Comparison

Choosing the appropriate legal form for a business is a complex decision, with various factors influencing the choice. The decision is not permanent, as entities can often change their legal form when business circumstances evolve.

### 6.3.6.1 Expense
- **Sole Proprietorships & General Partnerships**: Easier and cheaper to set up, but involve unlimited liability, making them unsuitable for riskier ventures like technology businesses. A Limited Liability Entity (LLC) might offer better protection in many cases.

### 6.3.6.2 Shareholder Options
- **C-Corporations**: Ideal for businesses planning to have many passive shareholders or a public stock offering. They can issue shares to attract capital and offer stock options to employees.
- **S-Corporations**: Can only issue common stock and are limited in the number and type of shareholders. C-Corporations are preferred for public offerings.

### 6.3.6.3 Taxation
- **C-Corporations**: Subject to corporate tax on income. Owners are not taxed on retained earnings, but may face double taxation on dividends. In some cases, C-Corporations may offer a lower combined tax bill compared to pass-through entities.
- **LLCs and S-Corporations**: Offer pass-through taxation, allowing profits and losses to be passed to owners. An S-Corporation provides a unique advantage in managing self-employment taxes by taxing salary only, not dividends, as long as compensation is reasonable.

### 6.3.6.4 Distribution of Profits and Losses
- **LLCs**: Can allocate profits and losses disproportionately to ownership percentages through the operating agreement. Limited liability remains regardless of management control.
- **S-Corporations & LPs**: Profits and losses in an S-Corporation must align with ownership percentages. LPs have management control limitations to maintain limited liability.
- **Flexibility of LLC**: The LLC can distribute profits or losses in ways that benefit members, such as allocating more losses to attract investors for tax benefits. Additionally, LLCs are not subject to restrictions on shareholder numbers and types like S-Corporations.

### 6.3.6.5 Formalities

The formation of LPs, corporations, and LLCs all requires comparable effort and cost. Below is a comparison of the organic documents required for the formation of different limited liability entities.

#### Exhibit 6.7: Comparison of Organic Documents for Different Types of Limited Liability Entities

| **Entity Type**          | **Limited Partnership (LP)**                | **Corporation**                          | **LLC**                                  |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Filing Required**       | Required but not filed                     | Required but not filed                   | Not required but desirable               |
| **Certificate/Document**  | Certificate of Limited Partnership         | Articles of Incorporation/Charter        | Articles of Organization                 |
| **Operating/Other Docs**  | Limited Partnership Agreement              | Bylaws                                   | Operating Agreement                      |
| **Shareholder Agreement** | Not Required                               | Shareholders Agreement                   | Not Required                             |

### Key Points:
- **LLCs**: Do not have the same formal requirements for meetings, minutes, and other procedures as corporations. 
- **LPs**: Similarly, LPs do not need to observe the same formalities. However, they require a general partner, which is often a separate limited liability entity.
- **LLCs vs. LPs**: The LLC structure provides the same limited liability benefits as an LP, but without the complexity of needing a separate general partner.



## 6.4 EQUITY AND EQUITY TYPES

Equity is simply another term for an ownership interest in a business. The particular terminology used to denominate equity varies depending upon the legal structure of the entity. As noted earlier, equity interests in partnerships and LLCs are typically referred to in terms of ownership percentages or units corresponding to a percentage of ownership. Equity in a corporation is referred to as "stock" for shares (Exhibit 6.8).

#### Exhibit 6.8: Terminology for Ownership Interests

| **Entity Type**    | **Partnership**            | **Corporation**        | **LLC**                |
|--------------------|----------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| **Equity Term**    | Units or percentage        | Stock or shares        | Units or percentage    |

### 6.4.1 Corporate Stocks

The articles of incorporation for a corporation specify a maximum total number of shares of stock that it is authorized to issue. The original number of shares of authorized stock is largely arbitrary, but it should be selected carefully based on the venture's financial plan and future fundraising objectives. The number of authorized shares can be changed, but only through a vote by the venture's shareholders.

From the authorized pool of shares, the venture can issue shares to founders and investors. The issued shares constitute the ownership structure of the venture. That is, a shareholder's percentage of ownership of the venture is calculated as the proportion of shares held compared to shares that have been issued. Most ventures will reserve a portion of the authorized shares in the company's treasury for later use. These are called unissued shares or treasury stock.

It is also important to note that not all stock is created equal. A venture's articles of incorporation can be crafted to allow it to issue different classes of shares, each with specific designations and unique preferences, limitations, and/or rights. These share classes are typically associated with financing rounds and are often designated as Class A, Class B, etc., or Series A, Series B, etc. 

The articles of incorporation either specify the particulars of each class of shares or delegate the authority to the board of directors. Generally, the preferences and relative rights of classes of shares relate to voting, payment of dividends, and distribution of corporate assets upon dissolution. Limitations on a class of shares typically involve restrictions on transferability. Shareholders of private ventures usually do not want to leave it up to shareholders to decide to whom they may transfer their shares. Transferability is often governed by buy-sell clauses in the shareholders' agreement.

### Common Stock vs. Preferred Stock

The two common types of stock are **common stock** and **preferred stock**. Both represent ownership interests and rights in a corporation, but they differ significantly in terms of rights and benefits, which we will explore further below.

### 6.4.2 Common Stock

Common stock refers to the baseline of ownership in a corporation and grants a right to a portion of profits from the company. Many ventures do not specifically define common stock. Instead, they refer to classes of stock with different characteristics without categorizing any particular class as common stock. If only one class of stock is issued, it will be common stock. As used in this text, common stock means a class of stock that does not have any preference over another class of stock.

Common stock is normally last in line when dividends are paid and in the event of liquidation. In a liquidation scenario, creditors, bondholders, and preferred stockholders are paid first, and common stockholders are entitled only to what remains.

Owners of common stock typically have voting rights to elect members of the board of directors, who oversee the management and operations of the company. Different classes of stock may have different voting rights, as will be discussed. The company’s profits may be paid out in the form of dividends to common stockholders. However, dividends on common stock are not guaranteed and usually only occur when the company is profitable. The amount and timing of dividends are determined by the board of directors.

Owners of common stock benefit from increases in the company’s value as it grows. However, if the company is unsuccessful, the value of their ownership interest decreases. Therefore, common stock provides the greatest potential for upside, but it also carries the greatest risk of loss if the business does not succeed.

### 6.4.3 Preferred Stock

Preferred stock refers to any stock that has advantageous characteristics over other classes of stock. Typically, preferred stock includes provisions that:

- Provide a specific dividend on a periodic basis (e.g., monthly, quarterly, semiannually, or annually)
- Rank senior to other classes of stock in the order of distribution (i.e., payments are made to the preferred stockholders before dividends are paid to other classes or when there is a distribution upon liquidation)
- Indicate that preferred shareholders have limited or no voting rights

Preferred stock tends to be a more conservative investment than common stock, as it is not as volatile. Investors purchase preferred stock for the dividends. Unlike dividends on common stock, which are paid at the discretion of the board of directors, dividends on preferred shares are often a fixed amount regardless of the company’s earnings. In some cases, the right to those dividends may accrue on a periodic basis. 

Although payment of dividends on preferred stock is not guaranteed per se, preferred dividends are guaranteed to be paid before any payments are made to junior classes of stock.

Preferred stock can also include a wide range of additional benefits, often referred to as “sweeteners.” Some of these advantages are discussed below.

### 6.4.3.1 Preferred Stock Distributions

A class of preferred stock can entitle the holders to distributions—dividends—and specify how those distributions are calculated. For example, dividends for a class of stock may be either **cumulative** or **noncumulative**.

- **Cumulative Preferred Stock**: This type of preferred stock has a provisional right to a dividend payment that accrues periodically. All accrued dividends must be paid to the holders of this class before any dividends can be paid to junior classes of stock. For example, if a company issues a preferred class of stock with a fixed quarterly dividend, but due to financial difficulties the company suspends dividend payments to cover expenses, the company must pay all accrued dividends to the preferred stockholders once it resumes dividends, before paying any to junior classes of stock.

- **Noncumulative Preferred Stock**: Dividends on noncumulative preferred stock do not accumulate. If no dividend is paid in a particular period, the shareholder is not entitled to receive any dividends for that period. However, noncumulative preferred shareholders are still entitled to receive dividends before any junior class of stock when dividends are paid again.

### 6.4.3.2 Convertibility

A class of preferred stock can also be **redeemable** or **convertible** into cash, debt, common stock, or other property. The conversion may be triggered by various conditions:

- At the option of the **corporation**, the **shareholder**, or another party
- Upon the occurrence of a **designated event** (e.g., a venture capital funding round)

The terms of conversion can be a specific amount or determined through a designated formula or by referencing some prespecified external data or events.

### 6.4.3.3 Participating Preferred

Preferred stock that pays a fixed dividend, regardless of the company's profitability, is known as **nonparticipating preferred stock**. However, preferred stock can also be structured to **participate** in the company's profits.

For example, **participating preferred stock** may entitle the holder to:

- A **fixed dividend**, and
- A share of the surplus profits after dividends are paid to common stockholders.

In some cases, the participation may extend to:

- **Dividends**: The preferred stockholder may receive the greater of the fixed dividend or the dividends paid to common stock (or the dividends paid to the common stock, if the preferred stock is convertible to common stock).
- **Liquidation**: If the company is liquidated, nonparticipating preferred stockholders typically receive a predetermined preferential return (e.g., the initial investment plus accrued and unpaid dividends) before any distributions to junior classes of stock. However, if the company is sold at a sufficiently high valuation, common stockholders may receive more than the preferred stockholders. If the preferred stock is **convertible**, preferred shareholders may have the option to convert their shares into common stock, forfeiting their preferential return in exchange for the potential to share in the liquidation proceeds on the same basis as common stockholders.

Participating preferred stockholders may have the best of both worlds: they receive the predetermined preferential return, and they may also participate in the distribution of remaining assets on an “as converted to common stock” basis with common stockholders.

### 6.4.3.4 Voting Rights

Although at least one class of shares must have voting rights (and, in combination with other classes, voting rights that cover all matters defined in the articles of incorporation requiring votes), a preferred stock class may be given special, conditional, or limited voting rights, or, in some cases, no voting rights at all.

Typically, **common stock** grants one vote per share, but a corporation can issue different "classes" of common stock, each with distinct voting rights. Voting rights can range from no voting rights at all to multiple votes per share.

### 6.4.3.5 Founder's Stock

**Founder's stock** refers to stock issued to the founders of the corporation. However, there is no universal definition of founder's stock in terms of its characteristics. If the corporation issues a single class of stock, founder's stock is simply common stock issued to the founders. However, founder's stock can sometimes be a separate class of stock with unique characteristics. 

For example, the company founders may issue two classes of stock: 
- **Class A stock**, which has one vote per share, and 
- **Class B stock**, which has 10 votes per share.

In this case, the founders would offer the **Class A stock** to investors and issue the **Class B stock** to themselves, ensuring they retain decision-making control of the company through super-voting rights.

Some common characteristics proposed for founder's stock include:
- **Conversion rights**: The right to convert shares into any other class of stock when that class is offered to investors.
- **Liquidation preferences**: Assigning liquidation preferences at a designated amount (e.g., the actual money invested by the founders, a specified percentage of their holdings, or the company valuation prior to a successive round of financing).
- **Preferred participating stock**: Making the founder's stock preferred and participating.

If part of the founder's contribution to the venture is **sweat equity**, the founder's stock may be subject to a **vesting requirement**, typically based on a predetermined, time-based schedule or formula. Actual ownership of stock does not transfer until the vesting condition is met.

However, there is often a tension between creating a special class of founder's stock with protective features and attracting future investors for subsequent rounds of financing. In many instances, investors will attempt to negotiate away the founder's preferences as a precondition to investment.

**Tax implications**: Founders must also understand the tax consequences of receiving stock in return for services. Generally, such stock is considered income to the founder. Under U.S. tax law, the founder has the option to recognize income (the difference between the fair market value and the price paid for the stock) either when the stock is issued or when it vests. If the founder elects to recognize the stock's value as income when issued, an **83(b) election** must be filed with the IRS within 30 days. This election helps freeze the ordinary income tax recognition at the issue date and starts the one-year capital-gain holding period.

### 6.5 Raising Capital

As previously noted, at some point during a venture's life, it will need to reach outside itself for necessary resources, one of which is **capital**.

For a transactional analysis of the process of forming a venture and bringing investors into the venture, it is useful to adopt a **co-venturing paradigm**. The business venture is considered a separate entity from each individual participant or investor (co-venturer), and each co-venturer contributes to the venture in return for some form of consideration.

The consideration provided by the respective co-venturers can take various forms, such as:
- **Money**
- **Intangible assets** (e.g., intellectual property)
- **Tangible assets**
- **Services**

The consideration provided by the venture to the co-venturers can take forms like:
- **Equity in the venture**
- **Money** (e.g., interest on a loan)
- **Profit interest** in the venture

Exhibits 6.9 and 6.10 illustrate such an analysis for the formation of a business venture and the introduction of investors to an existing business, respectively.

The consideration given to an investor in return for investment is effectively the cost of the investment to the pre-investment venture principals. Financing is categorized based on the consideration given to the investor. For example:
- **Debt financing** involves borrowing money or selling bonds, where the venture agrees to pay back the principal amount plus interest. The lender contributes money in exchange for a promise to be repaid with interest.
- **Equity financing** involves selling equity (ownership) in the venture to the investor, who contributes money in exchange for an ownership interest.

### 6.6 Equity Distribution in the Start-up Venture

When a business is founded by multiple people, the equity distribution reflects the relative value of each contributor's input. If contributions are monetary, ownership percentages are based on the amount each person contributes. For nonmonetary contributions, such as intellectual property, services, or credibility, these can be compensated with equity, though the relative value of these contributions can be harder to assess.

Factors influencing the valuation of nonmonetary contributions include:
- **Relevance** to the venture (e.g., the core idea or technology)
- **Demonstrable merit** (e.g., a working prototype vs. an unproven idea)
- **Legal protections** (e.g., patents)
- **Expertise**, **track record**, and **network connections**

In practice, negotiation skills often play a significant role in determining equity percentages, especially in start-ups where standard valuation techniques may not apply.

### 6.6.1 Employee Stock Options

ESO plans are used by companies to reward employees, attract talent, and retain a motivated workforce. Employees are given the right to purchase company stock at a specific price (strike price) within a defined time frame (exercise period). When exercised, employees benefit from the difference between the market price and strike price.

### 6.6.2 Vesting

Vesting refers to the conditions an employee must meet before being able to exercise their stock options. Typically, employees must remain with the company for a set period. A common vesting schedule might allow 25% of the options to vest after 12 months, with the remaining 75% vesting gradually over the next few years. 

### 6.6.3 Restrictive Clauses

ESO plans often have restrictions on stock transferability after options are exercised. These may include prohibitions on selling stock for a period, requirements to sell stock back to the company upon leaving, or right-of-first-refusal clauses if the stock is to be sold to an outside party.

### 6.6.4 Tax Issues

In the U.S., there are two types of ESO plans:
1. **Incentive Stock Options (ISOs)**: These qualify for special tax treatment. The exercise and grant are not taxable events. Taxes are deferred until the stock is sold, and if certain conditions are met, income is taxed at long-term capital gains rates.
2. **Nonqualified Stock Options (NSOs)**: These are more common and are taxed as ordinary income when exercised. The difference between the market value and strike price is taxed as ordinary income. If the stock value decreases after exercise, the employee still pays taxes on the spread, creating potential tax anomalies.
